1. Intro**********************************KH1********************************
Welcome to another KH walkthrough of mine, my third thus far. This one is on
the highly-acclaimed third game in the series: Kingdom Hearts II. Everything
you should need, and more, is here, so enjoy.

2. Version History**********************************KH2**********************
v0.01 - Got the overall format laid out. Also finished the Intro and Legal
        sections. Did Section I of the walkthrough.  12:03 AM 4/25/2011
v0.03 - Decided to expand the FAQ beyond the walkthrough; got the very basic
        format for those sections done. Also did Sections II and III, as well
        as the initial bits of Section IV, of the walkthrough.
        11:39 PM 4/25/2011
v0.10 - Making very slow headway into this. Finished Section IV and got to the
        Thresholder/Possessor boss in Section V of the walkthrough. Also, the
        FAQ now has a current size of 103 KB.  11:58 PM 4/26/2011
v0.17 - Lack of updates for reasons that would be not worth mentioning in a
        version history; e-mail me if you actually care enough. I did finish
        Sections V, VI, and VII, as well as a very small part of Section VIII.
        12:07 AM 5/4/2011
v0.30 - Finished Sections VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Also finished a small bit
        of Section XIII.  1:33 AM 5/5/2011
v0.40 - Finished Sections XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI of the walkthrough. Also did
        a very small bit of Section XVII. The size now reached 202 KB. Making
        some faster headway, eh?  1:13 AM 5/6/2011
v0.65 - Finished Sections XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, XXV,
        and XXVI of the walkthrough fully. Also did a small bit of Section
        XXVII.  12:47 AM 5/7/2011
v0.85 - Finished Sections XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXI, XXXII, XXXIII, and
        XXXIV of the walkthrough. The FAQ size is now about 300 KB. In
   __   addition, the Walkthrough is now ~85% done!!  12:09 AM 5/9/2011
v0.99 - Finished Sections XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XL, and XLI of
        the walkthrough in entirety. As for Section XLII -- the last one --
        all that is left is the final boss. After that, the walkthrough will
        be finished!!  11:58 PM 5/9/2011
v1.00 - The walkthrough is now finished. Seeing as I started late tonight, I
        went to the easier stuff: the items and bonuses. I finished the items;
        still working on most of Sora's bonuses. The current size is now
        417 KB.  12:03 AM 5/16/2011
v1.10 - Finished the Abilities and Bonus listings, the Magic listings, and
        Sections I, II, and III of the sidequests. Now working on some chests.
        12:04 AM 5/17/2011
v1.20 - Finished listing the Treasures. Due to little time left after that, I
        also finished the Sephiroth strategy, and listed all Summons and Drive
        Forms. The size is now 533 KB, meaning that AT THIS MOMENT, this is my
        second-largest FAQ/Walkthrough, losing by 24 KB (to Paper Mario: The
        Thousand-Year Door).  12:02 AM 5/18/2011
v1.30 - Finished the Minigames & Missions. Spent some time on the synthesis
        section. The FAQ/Walkthrough is now my largest at 606 KB -- and it
        WILL get much larger!  11:56 PM 5/18/2011
v1.99 - Finished everything... except a few bestiary items. I guess about 10
        to 15. The size reached over 700 KB today! O_o   11:56 PM 5/19/2011
Final - Okay, that's it. I have finished the Enemy Bestiary, and skimmed over
        the basic formatting of the FAQ. As such, I think I'm done.
          ~~ Start-to-end time: 27 days
          ~~ FAQ size         : 711 KB
          ~~ Time of Update   : 12:39 AM 5/21/2011

                              O---------------O
                              |  The 1st Day  |
                              O---------------O

After the opening song, you'll see a cutscene. The light-brown spiky-haired kid
in the group, Roxas, is who you'll play as for the moment. Roxas and his three
friends -- Hayner, Pence, and Olette -- are discussing the recent stream of
crimes happening around Twilight Town.

After the cutscene, you'll get control of Roxas. You'll be told the controls
as they come needed. To start, you'll learn how to walk and run -- by using the
the LEFT Analog Stick. After the quick scene, you'll talk to another person by
using the Triangle Button's Reaction Command. This can occur in battle (the
Reaction Command, not talking), and do things such as blocking or countering.
After THAT scene, you'll speak with the lady owning the Candy Shop. Use (I
think) R1 to lock-on to the cat on the awning to save it.

Later, after a scene, Roxas will get in a fight with Seifer. You are allowed
to choose a weapon. You'll get a slight stat boost depending on the chosen
weapon.

~~ Regular Struggle club: +1 Strength
~~ Club with handguard  : +1 Defense
~~ Club with star       : +1 Magic

============
BOSS: Seifer
============

Before the real fight, you'll be allowed to hit Seifer as a tutorial. Use X
when the cursor is over ATTACK to physically hit the enemy. Continually press
X to do a combo. For now, your combo limit is three hits. You can also jump
with Circle and attack for an aerial combo. Like with a ground combo, you are
limited to three hits.

This battle can be dealt with the mash X idea. Just note that you can lose in
a way (not a Game Over), but it won't change much. As such, you may want to try
your hand at dodging attacks and parrying attacks (by attacking at the same
time as the enemy). Although Roxas will recover first, most other enemies will
recover from a parry faster than you.


After the battle, a Dusk (the creature) will come and grab the camera from
Pence. Roxas will follow it through town, into the woods, to the gate of the
old mansion. You will begin to battle it, but you'll obviously notice that the
Dusk cannot be hit with a mere Struggle club (seem familiar, KH1 players?).
For now, try to practice some more dodging and using the Reaction Command
Reversal (which will tie up the Dusk for a bit).

After a little while, Roxas will obtain a new weapon that replaces his club.
This weapon, the Keyblade, will now physically hit the Dusk. As before, you
should still use Reversal, but also use that free time to deal some hits to it.

After the battle, Roxas will recieve the pictures stolen from the camera, as
well as earn 150 Munny. There is then another scene.

                              O---------------O
                              |  The 2nd Day  |
                              O---------------O

The next day, in the Usual Spot, after the scene, walk into the glowing circle.
This thing, a Save Point, will fully heal your HP and MP, and give you a chance
to save the game. Press the Triangle button while inside the circle to save.
After that, Pence will give you the map to Twilight Town.

So, it has been decided a trip to the beach is in order. One problem: you are
3,200 Munny short. So, you have decided to do some quick work. Not too hard,
I guess. You supposedly have to earn 800 Munny to pick up your share, but you
can earn more or less. Whenever you are done, just head to the Station Plaza
and speak with Hayner. There are six jobs available, three at Station Heights
and three in Tram Common. Your performance on the job determines how much Munny
you'll get.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mail Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to deliver five letters as fast as possible. Use the Reaction Command
to deliver a letter.

For easy money, head down the hill and deliver the first three letters as you
go down. Next, press TRIANGLE to do onto the railing and get launched into the
air, delivering a letter to the bird. Pull a 180 and deliver the fifth letter
to the girl.

Less than 20 seconds     = 50 Munny
20 seconds to 60 seconds = 30 Munny
More than 1 minute       = 10 Munny

~~~~~~~~~~~
Cargo Climb
~~~~~~~~~~~

For this, you'll be hitting a bag that is on a cart up the hill. Start always
by locking-on to the bag and use combos (aerial combos are fastest). At some
point, the bag will bounce into the air; hit it then for extra distance.

It will help to get the cart and bag caught up against the wall so they don't
constantly move to the sides.

Less than 30 seconds     = 50 Munny
30 seconds to 60 seconds = 30 Munny
More than 1 minute       = 10 Munny

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Grandstander
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember that Rare Truffle game from the first Kingdom Hearts or that Vacation
mission from 358/2 Days? The same idea is used here.

You'll basically hit the ball into the air and use hits to keep it in the air.
I'll usually just lock-on to it, hit it three times into the air, then jump
into the air for another combo, and continue like that. You'll be allowed to
let the ball hit the ground five times; after that, it is over.

20+ hits         = 50 Munny
5 to 19 hits     = 30 Munny
Less than 5 hits = 10 Munny

~~~~~~~~~~~
Poster Duty
~~~~~~~~~~~

For this, you'll be putting up twenty posters. Whenever you find a yellow
marking on a wall, press Triangle near it to put up a poster there. You may
find trios of markings: quickly press Triangle to "combo-post" three posters.
This one can give you more Munny easily than the rest.

Less than 1 minute, 30 seconds    = 100 Munny
1 minute, 30 seconds to 2 minutes = 50 Munny
More than 2 minutes               = 30 Munny

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bumble-Buster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this, you'll simply use your Struggle club to defeat two waves of four
swarms of bees. Each swarm has an HP of about two hits. Try to hit them while
they're still grouped together. The second wave of four swarms appears after
the first wave is gone.

Less than 20 seconds     = 50 Munny
20 seconds to 60 seconds = 30 Munny
More than 1 minute       = 10 Munny

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Junk Sweeper
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this job, you'll be destroying garbage by hitting it with a Struggle club.
Your performance it based on how much swings you take. To start, simply do a
combo -- don't move anywhere. This should leave three pieces on the far wall.
Go behind the left one and push it so it can be hit into the other two. After
that, just combo the other two into each other.

Less than 10 swings = 50 Munny
11 to 14 swings     = 30 Munny
15+ swings          = 10 Munny


Again, whenever you feel ready, go to Station Plaza and speak with Hayner.
Again, depending on how much Munny you hand over, you'll recieve certain
amounts of AP:

~~ Less than 200 Munny = AP +0
~~ 200 - 799 Munny     = AP +1
~~ 800 - 1,999 Munny   = AP +2***
~~ 2,000 Munny or more = AP +2 (the game automatically progresses)

*** I have heard that, depending on the game version, the minimum amount of
    Munny for AP +2 may be 1,200 Munny. I would like a confirmation.

Between all of you, you have earned 5,000 Munny. Roxas is given the Munny
Pouch -- and soon loses it. There are then some depressing scenes.

                              O---------------O
                              |  The 3rd Day  |
                              O---------------O

The next day, head to Station Heights for a scene. After gaining control of
Roxas, you'll be battling some more Dusks and, as before, you cannot hit them
with a mere Struggle club. After some scenes...

Oh, not again. Remember the sword/shield/rod thing from KH1 and Re:coded? You
have to do that again. This time, your stats and abilities are affected by
what you choose. Here is the basic list of abilities depending on your choice:

O========================================================================O

|  49  |  Finishing Plus     |  Second Chance      |  Berserk Charge     |
|  53  |  Thunder Boost      |  Lucky Lucky        |  MP Rage            |
|  59  |  Defender           |  Blizzard Boost     |  Combination Boost  |

|  85  |  Second Chance      |  Berserk Charge     |  Finishing Plus     |
|  99  |  MP Rage            |  Thunder Boost      |  Lucky Lucky        |
O------O---------------------O---------------------O---------------------O

Whatever you choose, you'll then get the Keyblade. Immediately afterwards,
you'll fight the three Dusks. Nothing too hard, just use Reserval and attack.

After the battle, you'll earn a Bonus Level. Defeating certain bosses and the
like will potentially increase your Bonus Level. These are separate from the
levels earned by EXP., as shown above. Therefore, you can get a Bonus Level
even if you are LV. 99 (or is it 100?). For the most part, you'll get higher
stats (primarily HP and MP), new abilities, or more item/equipment slots. In
this case, you have earned the ability Aerial Recovery. To equip it, press
START and enter the Abilities menu. It is worth equipping.

After that, use the Reaction Command to open the nearby chest and get a
Potion. Use the Save Point (FYI, if you hit 0 HP from here on out, it is going
to be a Game Over) and go through the door.

As you go up the platforms and pathways, you'll fight some more enemies. You
may as well, especially if you're on Proud Mode, for some EXP. and levels.
There is a chest on the second platform; open it to recieve another Potion.
When you're ready, go through the door on the third platform.

As with Sora's encounter in this... place, Roxas is now thrust into a boss
battle.

====================
BOSS: Twilight Thorn
====================

Immediately after the battle starts, you'll find yourself chained in the air,
bonded by floating white energy. The Twilight Thorn will come face to face
with Roxas, pulling its... fist back to swing. Suddenly, a Reaction Command
called Key Counter will appear. Hit Triangle now, lest you be hit with a fist
the size of your body. If you succeed, you'll strike the enemy in the face,
sending it reeling back.

Soon after that, the Twilight Thorn will recover its composure. This time, it
will grab you from a distance (regardless of whether you succeed with the Key
Counter). You'll be flung high into the air. As you return to... Earth, the
Twilight Thorn will try to spike you into the ground. If you use the Reaction
Command that appears (Lunarsault), you'll hit the enemy. This time, it will
slink underneath the platform.

For a short time, you can run freely. After that short time, the Twilight Thorn
will tilt the platform, prompting Roxas to thrust the Keyblade into the
platform in an attempt to hang on. It is in vain; the platform is hurled into
the air and flips. As it does, you'll fall towards the Twilight Thorn... or,
actually, the M-A-S-S-I-V-E ball of energy it has summoned. Things will slow
down, giving you a chance to use the Reaction Command Break Raid. This will
shatter the ball of energy, sending both you and the Twilight Thorn slamming
onto the platform. Use this time to smack the enemy a few times.

After this, you'll be starting the real battle. As before, the only weak
point is the head. Hit it while you can; you won't get many chances. It may
send out arcs of energy; use Reversal to avoid these (no enemies will be
stunned...).

After the battle, you'll earn a Bonus Level, expanding the HP max by five and
giving you the Guard ability.

                              O---------------O
                              |  The 4th Day  |
                              O---------------O

After the battle, there will be some scenes, putting you into the fourth day.
Today is the day of the Struggle tournament. For the moment, you do several
things: fight Seifer in the alley (13 EXP.), shop in Station Heights...
 ___________________________
|  Twilight Town Item Shop  \
|____________________________\_______________________________________________
|  Item Name ......................................................... Cost  |
|============================================================================|
|  Potion .......................................................  40 Munny  |
|  Tent ......................................................... 100 Munny  |
|____________________________________________________________________________|

.... do some jobs like before, or actually enter the competition.

When you finally want to enter the tournament, talk to the guy beside the
chalkboard to listen to the rules. To enter your first match, talk to the man
in the center of the platform to begin.

Quick hint: you can just grab a couple of the person's orbs and run around the
arena to win when time runs out (you just must have 101 or more orbs). You can
also automatically win by getting 200 orbs.

----------------
MINIBOSS: Hayner
----------------

Hayner can do a basic ground and aerial combo. He can also do a lunge or a
thrust or whatever you call it. For the most part, just wail on him and then
grab his orbs and avoid him for a bit.


After the fight, mess around some as before. When ready, talk to the man in
the center of the platform.

--------------
MINIBOSS: Vivi
--------------

For the most part, Vivi will swing his club, which grows fairly large, making
it hard to avoid. You can tell what specific attack he'll do just by his
stance or what he says.


After beating Vivi, time will freeze (it's like a Twix commercial) and three
Dusks will appear. You'll also get the Keyblade, so don't worry. Defeat the
Dusks, and, after the scene, you'll fight Axel.

===========================================
BOSS: Organization XIII's Number VIII, Axel
===========================================

Most of Axel's attacks are frontal. You can avoid a good deal of them by
jumping to the side or behind him. While you do so, you may as well use the
momentum from a combo to hit Axel.

There are two attacks I want you to especially aware of.

Whenever Axel says, "Don't make me mad!", get out of the way fast or his fiery
Chakrams will hit you several times.

Whenever Axel begins to crouch, hit him quickly. If you do not, he'll launch a
powerful attack; block it with Guard.

Other than that, wail on him whenever possible.


After the battle with Axel and the following scene, time will return to normal.
A confused Vivi and walk away. Go ahead and mess around some more, then start
the last Struggle for a while.

----------------
MINIBOSS: Setzer
----------------

Setzer leaves himself open quite a lot. For the most part, you can just wail
on him; he'll rarely parry or even attempt to strike. You'll just have to be
aware of his spinning attack: it'll hit several times and take quite a few
orbs out of you.

If you win, you'll get the Champion Belt. If you lose, you'll get a Medal.
Either way, you'll end up with the Struggle Trophy. In the following scenes,
you'll lose the trophy but gain the Crystal Orb.

                              O---------------O
                              |  The 5th Day  |
                              O---------------O

So, it is now apparent that Roxas the rest of the group have to finish their
summer homework. They decide to do it on the Seven Wonders of Twilight Town.

Begin by going to the Station Plaza. Enter Central Station and you'll end up
at Sunset Terrace.

During this time, talking to Pence will bring up a map of five of the wonders.
When you investigate one, it will be checked off. The first was solved during
the cutscene. Head to the next area.

There is some treasure here. So, find the tram in the southern part of the
area. Use the Reaction Command two times to get onto it. One chest you'll find
on a house will contain the Ability Ring; equip it. From the chest, drop down
next to the tree. The nearby chest will contain a Potion. At the north end of
the stream, you'll find a chest with a Hi-Potion inside. Near the entrance to
Sunset Hill will be another chest; open it to get the Potion.

You can investigate the five wonders in any order.

~~ In the northeastern part of the area, find Hayner. He'll be near an alley.
   Go to the end of the alley and inspect the wall with the Reaction Command.
   You'll run out as a ball leaves the wall. After that, you are to inspect
   the wall again, but balls keep getting spawned out of the wall. You can
   knock them aside with Attacks. When you get to the wall, inspect it once
   again to finish it.

~~ Find the stream along the northern part of Sunset Terrace. Along it, you'll
   find a tunnel. Go near it and enter it with Triangle. After the scene, you
   will fight three Vivi clones. More and more will keep on appearing. They
   aren't too hard; one hit usually gets rid of one. After they are defeated,
   you have finished this one.

~~ Go to the waterfall in the southwest corner. When you examine it with
   Triangle, your doppelganger will come out of the waterfall (!!) and fight
   you. Simply wail on it and you'll defeat it. Defeat it to finish this one.

~~ Now, exit Sunset Terrace to the west; this will take you to Sunset Hill. Go
   to the top of the hill and investiage the bag with Triangle. After the quick
   scene, begin to jump onto the bag with Triangle by running at it. When you
   are on the bag, use the Reaction Commands to avoid being knocked off. As you
   remain on the bag, the gauge in the corner will empty. Once it does, you are
   finished.  ...!

After these five "wonders", Roxas and the group will decide to go up to Sunset
Hill for the sixth wonder: the Ghost Train. In the scene, Roxas will apparently
see the train, although his friends do not. The rest of that scene, I leave up
to you.  ...Where's the asylum, anyways?

After returning to Market Street and the rest of town, go to Tram Common and
go through the woods to the old mansion. There will be some more scenes, and
then day six starts.

                              O---------------O
                              |  The 6th Day  |
                              O---------------O

After you watch the initial scenes, you'll end up fighting some more Nobodies.
You'll begin with the basic Dusks. After they are gone, you'll end up fighting
an Assassin. While its "arms" are sticking out of the ground, try attacking and
you may drag it aboveground and stun it for a short time.

After the battle and resulting scenes, leave Axel -- yes, time has yet again
froze -- and go to the Old Mansion. If you decide to go to the Sandlot, you'll
find some more Dusks. At the mansion, Roxas will use the Keyblade to be allowed
inside because the gate was locked.

There are quite a few Nobodies crawling around, so be watchful. Also, on the
ground floor, go to the far end with the window for a chest (Hi-Potion). The
door to the west will lead to the dining room. There, you'll fight several
waves of Nobodies. Once that is over with, open the two chests for a Potion and
Elven Bandana. The latter will serve better than the Champion's Belt as armor,
so equip it.

Back in the foyer, go up the left staircase. Collect the two chests you'll find
nearby for two Potions (one in each). On the second floor, after opening the
aforementioned chest, turn around and go through the western door.

There will be a few scenes now, in regards to who Roxas actually is (or, more
appropriately, ISN'T). After them, you'll recieve Namine's Sketches and the
Mansion Map. Use the nearby Save Point and return to the foyer. There, go
through the eastern door on the second floor.

You'll arrive in the library. There, you'll be able to finish the picture on
the table to make the floor disappear, revealing another room. Go down there,
open the chest (Hi-Potion), and go through the doorway.

After doing so, there will be a few more scenes. You'll be given access to a
Save Point. I'd use it if I were you. When you're done, go through the unused
doorway.

In the next room, you'll fight four Dusks and two Assassins. Nothing worth
mentioning. However, after that...

===========================================
BOSS: Organization XIII's Number VIII, Axel
===========================================

You know, it is almost not worth mentioning this fight, seeing as Roxas is
simultaneously using the Oathkeeper and Oblivion Keyblades! Nevertheless, it
can be tough on newbies, so...

Axel will immediately start attacking from the beginning. The main point of
this is to turn the floor into a bed of cinders, which will slowly damage
Roxas. Obviously, begin hitting him. Eventually, you'll get access to a
Reaction Command: Overtaker. Use it, then, after another relentless beating,
use another Reaction Command: Clear Light. This will damage and stun Axel,
as well as remove the cinders from the floor. Keep wailing on Axel, until he
is behind the wall of fire.

While Axel is shielded by the flames, lock-on to him. He'll begin to fly out
of the flames randomly, trying to hit you. After he does, he'll return to the
fire. However, if you're locked-on, you can use Burst Edge to stop this.

For the most part, that's all he'll do. When he isn't doing this, wail on him.

After the battle, your max HP will increase by five.


After the battle, exit the room through the southwestern door. In the small
hallway, open the chest to obtain a Hi-Potion, then go through the next door.
This... will awaken Sora and finally bring up the title screen.

After the cutscenes, you are now in control of the slightly-bigger Sora (if
you remember, he was asleep for about a year!). Begin by opening up the menu
for Jiminy's Journal. You can figure out from here what treasures and maps you
have grabbed from each area; for this area, there are 15 chests. Two are behind
you, near the outer wall of the mansion (Potion) and to the right of the main
door (Mythril Shard).

When you go (back) into town, you'll meet Hayner's gang at the Usual Spot. You
are told that someone with "these big, round ears" is waiting at the Station
(Station Plaza). Firstly, though, let's do some treasure hunting.

Return to the forest to find a Potion, Hi-Potion, and Mythril Shard.

Go to the Sandlot to find that Seifer, the Struggle champion, is wishing to
start a brawl. Unfortunately AND fortunately for him, you cannot fight him. So,
head to Tram Common. Straight across from the Sandlot entrance is a chest with
a Hi-Potion inside. Behind the now-Synthesis (was the Candy) Shop in the
southwest corner is a chest with a Potion. Near the entrance to the woods is a
chest with a Potion. On the roofs of the central buildings are two chests, each
with a Mythril Shard. Near a light, to the left of the green-roofed building,
is a Tent inside of a chest. From the Tent chest, jump to the eastern blue-
roofed building to find an AP Boost in a chest. These are the chests for now;
there are three more coming in a bit.

While on the way to Station Heights, go to the shops. You should buy Donald
and Goofy some new weapons. Buy some Potions, as well.

So, in the plaza, you'll fight several waves of Nobodies. They are nothing
special, really. Eventually, though, you and your partners will get tired and
pretty much give up ("Giving up already? I though you were stronger than that!"
Remember that from KH1?). A shrouded figure (with obvious big, round ears) will
save you and hand you three items: a Munny Pouch, a Crystal Orb, and Secret
Ansem's Report #2. How did Mickey get those two items? They were supposed to
be with Ansem. Hmmm.... Anywho, enter the station.

When you do, use the Save Point and look around. You'll find the last three
chests for a moment: a Hi-Potion, Tent, and Mythril Shard. However, these
aren't the last. Talk to Donald to leave.

After the train ride, you'll end up in front of the tower. There are several
chests, which obviously means that the number of chests has expanded: to
twenty-two, to be exacr. The ones nearby will give a Potion, another Potion,
a Hi-Potion, and an Ether.

When you approach the front door, you'll start a scene with Pete. Pete, the
new slave of the late Maleficent, has control over the Heartless. He'll simply
summon some weak Shadows, a standard in any Kingdom Hearts. If you've never
played KH, you should simply consider Shadows the weaker Dusks of the
Heartless.

After the quick scene after the battle, you'll end up inside the tower. For
now, you won't be allowed outside: Pete is still there. So, for now, use the
Save Point and open the nearby chests (Ether, Mythril Shard).

Head up the stairs and through the rooms. Along the way, you'll fight some
Shadows and Soldiers, some battles on the stairway, which you can skip, and
some in the rooms, which you must fight. The third room will lead to Yen Sid's
room. He'll explain a few things and ask you to read a book containing info
vital to your journey (although I don't really get it). When you're done, talk
to Yen Sid about the enemies this time around.

After that, use the nearby Save Point. From the big chest, get the Tower Map.
Go to the next room. Before talking to the fairies, open the chest to get a
Mythril Stone. Then talk to the red fairy, Flora.

During the scene, Sora will be bestowed with his much-better duds. However,
these clothes are not mere thread: they allow the usage of the Drive Forms. A
Drive Form is an alternate, usually better, form (like with Giratina and
Shaymin off of Pokemon). You have access to only one of the Drive Forms: Valor
Form. This form, when your Drive Gauge is at Level 3 (charge the gauge by
getting Drive Orbs), will temporarily sacrifice Goofy so that Sora will be
allowed usage of TWO Keyblades and new abilities. Since you only have one
Keyblade, you are also given the Star Seeker Keyblade, which is, for now, only
allowed to be used for the Valor Form. When you get a third Keyblade, switch
stuff around.

So, after the scene, don't use your Valor Form. Save it for battle, where it
is more useful and can level up. Return to the previous room to start a
cutscene, in which you get the Gummi Ship.

From the world map, you are given a mere two choices: Twilight Town and Hollow
Bastion. Seeing as you've done all you can in Twilight Town, go to Hollow
Bastion. As for the in-flight battles: LATER.

Firstly, after the cutscene, head to the shops, although nothing is new except
an Ether at the item shop. Donald's Uncle Scrooge is in the area, so why not
talk to him. It seems that he is try to build an ice cream empire.  *shrugs*
Why not?

Close to Scrooge is the Synthesis Shop, which, as the name says, can take
various things, like Mythril Shards and Fire Stones, and transform them into
new items: anything from an AP Boost to the Ultima Weapon. For bringing the
Moogle one kind of material, you'll earn the Elixir. For now, you cannot make
anything, so you'll be waiting a while.

In the area just past the Moogle, you'll find the Borough. You'll also find
Yuffie, an old friend. You'll also find a not-so-old friend: Dusks. You may as
well use Valor Form for the battle here and get used to it; plus, it won't be
available in the next major battle. After the battle, Yuffie will invite you
to Merlin's house and give you the Marketplace Map.

So, after the scene, continue along the path on the ground. You'll soon find a
chest beside a door. Open the chest to obtain a Hi-Potion. The door itself will
go into Merlin's house, but wait a bit and grab some treasure. Continue further
along the path to find a Tent inside a chest. The steps nearby will take you to
a higher ledge. Find the crane and open the chest nearby to get an AP Boost.
Do a 180 and continue that way to find another chest, in which you'll find a
Drive Recovery. Continue further to find a Mythril Shard in a chest. Now, you
can go to Merlin's.

Inside Merlin's, you'll have a quick reunion with some old friends. Leon, also
known as Squall (Final Fantasy VIII), will ask Sora if he'll help out with the
town's restoration. Obviously, Sora will; you'll then be asked to go to the
bailey. As you leave, a scene will occur in which you recieve some Membership
Cards and the Blizzard magic. When Sora overcomes his short-term memory loss,
you'll be allowed to the bailey. Use the Save Point before leaving, though,
then go through the tunnel past the Mythril Shard chest from earlier.

As Leon shows you what has been plaguing Hollow Bastion -- Heartless and
Nobodies -- a voice is heard from outside. Organization XIII (missing some
people, aren't they?) will send some Nobodies out. Donald and Goofy will go
fight their own, leaving you and Leon to protect the gates.

This fight is somewhat tough. There are many Dusks and Samurais that appear,
and they will attack the gates. It is a Game Over should the gates lose all of
their "HP". Speaking of HP, Nobodies will only drop MP orbs, not HP orbs, so
you'll have to rely on items for healing. Of course, you can use Blizzard,
although I find physical attacks better. Since there are Dusks, take advantage
of the Reversal Command. Speaking of Reaction Commands, Samurai can generate
another called Duel Stance. During the time freeze, find the command THE END
when it appear to kill/almost kill the Samurai.

After the battle, you'll also be allowed to cast Fire magic.

After some parting words from a member of Organization XIII (member No. II,
Xigbar), you obtain Secret Ansem's Report #7. Sora then soon unlocks the next
two worlds.

Seeing as you can do either world whenever, I'll cover them in the order I
usually do them.

When you land in this world, you immediately encounter Mulan... uh, PING, in a
cutscene, as well as Mushu. Ping will automatically join your party and be
forced to remain there for a while. In the area you landed in, open the three
chests to get a Hi-Potion, Ether, and Mythril Shard. You can also talk to the
holographic Moogle to shop and drop off synthesis items. Exit the area when you
are done.

In the encampment area, approach the mess hall line. In the scene, a brawl will
begin. The army Captain will come, calming everyone down... except those who
notice the Heartless. For this battle and most others in this world, you will
need to keep up the MORALE gauge by collecting orbs the enemies drop; if the
bar empties, it is Game Over. There are a few waves of Shadows, then you'll
fight a few of the new enemies: Nightwalkers.

After the battle, the Captain tell Sora, Donald, and Goofy that they did well,
although he doesn't the same of Ping. Sora insists that Ping has potential, so
the Captain will give you a chance to prove yourself: you will have three
missions to do. After the discussion, you'll get the Encampment Area Map.

First, before accepting a mission, go north to the Checkpoint. Here, you can
find a few chests and some enemies. At the Checkpoint, you cannot yet exit to
the north or the east. However, near the barred door to the east, you'll find
a chest containing a Mythril Shard. Further north from there is another chest,
in which you'll find a Hi-Potion. When ready, head back to the Encampment Area.
Talk to the Captain to accept one of the three missions: you'll have to do all
three eventually, so...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE SURPRISE ATTACK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this one, you'll simply do some battling against Shadows and Nightwalkers.
However, you'll have keep up the Morale gauge, so be sure to fight fast!

~~~~~~~~~~
THE AMBUSH
~~~~~~~~~~

You begin slow with just a few Shadows, but you'll eventually start fighting
some Nightwalkers and Assault Riders. Again, try to finish fast.

~~~~~~~~~~
THE SEARCH
~~~~~~~~~~

This one takes place in the camp. Eight Heartless are in the area, and you are
still bound to the Morale gauge. Just run around and tap R1 until you find one,
then you'll find some others nearby.


After all three missions, you'll get an AP Boost.

Return to the Bamboo Grove -- where you met Ping and Mushu -- and save. Shop as
needed. Now, the Captain has one final task for you. You are to scout to the
village near the mountain summit. You have authorized to pass the Checkpoint.

So, head to the Checkpoint area and exit to the north. Again, you are bound to
that friggin' Morale gauge, so work fast. Eliminate the first set of enemies
and use the Rockshatter Reaction Command (you must hit Triangle TWICE). Repeat
at the next wall and you'll get to the main area. We'll ignore the treasure
chests here until the Morale gauge is gone, so head right, not left, at the
fork. You'll come near another wall to use Rockshatter on; however, I'm fairly
sure that those two Assault Riders will bring some trouble. You may as well
defeat them for the EXP. After that, Rockshatter that wall and continue a bit
further along the path to eternally get rid of the Morale gauge.

In the village, Mushu believes he saw Shan-Yu go into the cave north of the
village. Ping has decided that you'll take care of it yourselves to prove
yourselves to the Captain. After the scene, you'll earn the Village Area Map.
Now, use the Save Point and shop, then return to the Mountain Trail.

There, upon entering the area, go straight to the two-chest platform. Those
chests contain an Ether and a Recovery Recipe. Get off the platform and go to
the right. The chest on the northwestern ledge will contain another Mythril
Shard. Near the beginning of the area, you'll find the last chest here, which
contains a Hi-Potion. Now, return to the Village. Use the Save Point and
Moogle Shop, then go into the cave to the northeast.

As you enter, you'll find a couple of chests, which contain a Hi-Potion and an
AP Boost. The large room of the cave at the end of the tunnel seems deserted,
but it seems that you've been led to a trap. Donald and Goofy are stuck behind
that weird magical barrier that appears, which means only one thing: you and
Ping are going to fight something. This "something" is actually some Shadows
and Assualt Riders. I prefer to take out the Riders first, as they'll do more
damage when left alone. After them, take out the Shadows. After all the enemies
are defeated, a second wave (two Assault Riders) comes. It is better to use
magic here, now that Shadows aren't in the way.

After the battle, Sora will learn Slide Dash, an ability. Ping's max HP will
increase and Ping will learn the Hyper Healing ability.

After the battle, Mushu believes that Ping will win acceptance with the Captain
without Shan-Yu. *snorts* Yeah, right. When you exit the cave, you find the
village burned down. It is then decided that you will travel up the mountain
to find and defeat Shan-Yu.

So, use the Save Point and shop, and exit the village to north; you'll reach
the small Ridge area. You'll also find the Rapid Thruster, a new kind of
Heartless. There are two chests here (Hi-Potion and AP Boost) as well as some
whirlwinds. Get familiar with their uses, as they'll come in handy later in
the game.

Once you get to the Summit area, you'll find Shan-Yu waiting with an army of
Heartless. This may freak you out some, seeing as you're alone against these
enemies (where did everyone else go?), but then you'll realize that you merely
have to fight for a minute. So, use the Speed Trap and Aero Blade Reaction
combo to really rack up some fast EXP. Bolt Reversal also does okay.

In the scene following the battle, Ping is revealed to be a woman, which
infuriates the Captain. Seeing as Ping -- I mean, MULAN, now, saved his life,
you won't be killed for treason (how it's treason, I don't know). Anywho, Mulan
will learn the Dragonblaze and Red Rocket abilities, and the latter is a Limit
command. When you return to the Ridge, you find that Shan-Yu is still alive and
heading for the Imperial City. Return to the Checkpoint and exit to the east,
which goes to the Imperial City.

When you enter the city, you'll catch up with some (or all? O_o) of the army.
The Captain won't listen to Mulan when she tries to tell him of Shan-Yu
(remember, she has essentially been convicted of treason), until he sees
Shan-Yu atop a building. Some Heartless will appear, and the Captain will take
off to protect the Emperor. The Heartless you have to fight is relatively weak:
four Nightwalkers and three Bolt Towers.

After the battle, proceed northward to the Palace Gates and approach Shan-Yu.
The Captain will go to protect the Emperor, but as for Shan-Yu...

=============
BOSS: Shan-Yu
=============

Remember that battle where you protected the gates in Hollow Bastion? Same idea
here. The Heartless will continuously spawn, and they drop orbs that restore
the gates' HP. Defeat as needed; there is no time limit for this boss.

As for Shan-Yu, parrying or guarding an attack will put you in a pushing match
against him: continually press Triangle for the Reaction Command "Push" until
you can use Takedown. Use it do a considerable amount of damage.

Other than that, it is a pretty basic fight. Ignore the falcon, as it isn't
able to do much and will come back a while after its HP is gone. Use the Valor
Form and Red Rocket Limit as much as you can to finish this quickly.

After the battle, Sora's max HP increases by 5 and he learns the ability Aerial
Sweep; Donald's max HP will increase by 4; Goofy will learn the Goofy Turbo
ability; and Mulan's max HP increases by 20.


After the battle, you are commended for what you have done. As with the
Membership Card in Hollow Bastion, Sora uses Shan-Yu's sword to unlock a new
path to new worlds. You also will recieve the Hidden Dragon Keyblade, which is
weaker than either Keyblade thus far, in terms of Strength.

|____________________________________________________________________________|

Upon landing, you'll arrive in Beast's huge castle. However, they don't even
realize it even is the Beast's castle until they hear his yells. After they
recognize who it is, they see a Heartless run into a side room, which they
proceed to fight.

You'll then end up fighting a bunch of Shadows. I always end up using the Valor
Form to make quick work of this. After a while, Beast will give out equal
shares of pain to the Shadows, and Sora, Donald, and Goofy. OWWWwww... Beast
merely grabs the rose and leaves.

You are still in the room, so use the Save Point and use the Moogle Shop. A
Silver Ring or two for Donald is good (they increase Magic) and a Sardonyx Ring
for Goofy (he relies fully on Strength). It is your choice what to buy for
Sora. When ready, head into the Entrance Hall.

As you look around the room, Donald will spot someone on the right-hand stairs.
Go and follow them. As you do, you'll encounter a new Heartless: the Hook Bat.
They aren't very strong for the most part.

Oh, yeah, before going up the stairs, exit to the south to the courtyard.
There, along the perimete, you'll find three chests. In them, you'll find a
Hi-Potion, an AP Boost, and a Mythril Shard.

So, after heading up the eastern staircase, you'll end up seeing Sora and the
trio breaking in on Belle, who tells them that you'll need to break the
servants out of the dungeon if you want stop Beast's mean streak. In the room,
you'll find a Mythril Shard and Castle Map in the nearby chests. Return to
the hallway.

There, you'll encounter new enemy (speaking specificly about KH2): the Large
Body. These enemies can only be damaged from the back, unless you use magic
attacks. (FYI/Spoiler: An ability in KH Re:coded (released on DS in 2011)
allows you to hit them from the front.) Here, if you do a combo on their back,
you'll be allowed to use Full Swing, which deals a fair amount of damage to it
and any enemies who happened to get in the way of the attack. As for the East
Wing itself, there are two chests, which contain a Hi-Potion and Tent. Make
your way back to the Entrance Hall.

When you re-enter the Entrance Hall, head to the stairs directly opposite the
East Wing and you'll end up in the West Hall, also activating a cutscene.

After the cutscene, turn around and make your way back to the entrance and
you'll two chests in the alcoves; you'll get a Hi-Potion and Mythril Shard from
them if they are opened. The suits of armor nearby, when hit, will produce a
few Drive Orbs. So, turn around and continue along the hallway. When you find
the blocked stairs, look to the right of the stairs for a Drive Recovery. A
Tent and Mythril Shard will be in two chests to the left of the stairs.

Now, "talk" to the dresser/cabinet/whatever behind you. She is directly in
front of the door to the basement, which is where the locked-up servants are.
So, press Triangle to push her (FROM THE LEFT!). As the dresser starts to stir
and the sleep bubbles or Z's disappear, stop or you'll Waken her. When she
returns to the world of dreams, continue the process until you finish. When you
do finish, she'll wake up and let you through after telling you a quick story
of how Beast came to be like he is (physically, not mentally).

In the next area, the gates are more than they first seem. They aren't gates;
they're Heartless!

================================
BOSS: Thresholder and Possessors
================================

The Thresholder is the form the Possessors take when merged with the gates.
They have a long reach and will swing their arms wildly at the start. As you
approach them to physically attack, a Gargoyle Warrior and Gargoyle Knight will
come to life and attack alongside them. Deal with them now, later, or never; it
doesn't matter.

After beating up the statues, try to approach the gates. Four Hook Bats will
now appear. Beat them and approach the Thresholder for one more wave of four
Hook Bats.

After this, it is just you and the boss. Fight it and deplete its remaining HP.
Once you do, use the Release Reaction Command. This will release a Possessor
from the gate, the main boss. Attack the Possessor and get rid of it to start
the fight nearly anew.

Now, the Thresholder gets an HP refill and can now shoot dark energy at you.
Again, deplete its HP and Release the Possessor and eliminate it and the boss.

After the battle, Sora will learn the Upper Slash ability; Donald will learn
the Donald Fire ability; and Goofy's max HP will increase by five.


After defeating the Thresholder and the Possessors, proceed through the
now-open gate into the Dungeon. There, four servants of the Beast -- Cogsworth,
Lumiere, Mrs. Potts, and Chip -- will be rescued. After the scene, you can open
the two nearby chests to recieve an AP Boost and a Basement Map.

Return to the Undercroft and jump up the pile of junk and you'll reach
Cogsworth. Speak with him and the suits of armor will move aside. Proceed to
the next area.

There, Cogsworth will hold a lever. This causes four lanterns, lit with dark
fire, to lower from the ceiling. Now, you will need Lumiere and Mrs. Potts to
follow you to each lantern. When you get to a lantern, wait for them to get
near and use the Reaction Command, which will cause Sora and Mrs. Potts to
disenchant and douse the flame and make Lumiere relight the lantern. Do this
with all four lanterns. Remember, seeing as Lumiere and Mrs. Potts cannot jump
well, you'll have to remove the boxes in the way. Also, Cogsworth can only hold
onto that lever for so long -- when he is low on energy, go help him with a
Reaction Command.

After all four lanterns are lit, Sora will push a stone into a wall, which
opens the path forward. After the cutscene, turn around and grab the three
chests in the area (a Hi-Potion, a Mega-Potion, and a Mythril Shard). When you
are ready, head through the doorway to the West Hall.

By the way, most (if not all) of the statues of the castle will come to life
in the form of a Gargoyle Warrior or Gargoyle Knight. Each can let you use the
Reaction Command Release, which is a one-hit kill. They are also immune to
magic. Anywho, once you reach the upper West Hall, open the chest (AP Boost)
and go through the door to the West Wing.

Upon entering, the chest directly in front of you will contain a Tent; the one
at the top of the stairs to the right will contain a Mythril Shard. Continue
northward to reach Beast's Room. There, you'll figure out why Beast is acting
so differently from his norm. A good old-fashioned beating should help.

===========
BOSS: Beast
===========

This battle is simple. Wail relentlessly on the Beast while you use the
Reaction Command to have Cogsworth try to talk sense into the Beast. This
Reaction Command has the main benefit of temporarily stunning Beast. Once the
Beast's HP is drained, hit Triangle repeatedly to charge up Cogsworth for one
last Command. If you succeed with this, you win. If not, you'll have to empty
the Beast's HP again.

For winning, Sora will get another Armor Slot; Donald's max HP will increase
by four; and Goofy will learn the Defender ability.


After the battle, Beast will join your party for the trip to Belle's room.
Also, before leaving, open the chest in the room to get the last chest in this
world for a while (Mega Recipe). Save and go to Belle's Room. You can simply,
from the West Hall, return to the Entrance Hall, as the suits of armor have
moved.

Speaking of the Entrance Hall, you'll find a new Heartless: the Lance Soldier.
They have a decent amount of health and power. When they are low on HP, they
may lunge at you, letting you use the Reaction Command Lance Tug, which will
damage them and nearby enemies.

In Belle's Room, you'll find that she has left. Use the Save Point and return
to the Entrance Hall, exiting through the northern large double doors. After
the scene, you'll fight the boss.

===================================
BOSS: Shadow Stalker and Dark Thorn
===================================

For the first form of the boss, it has four attacks and these attacks are
used in this order.

~~ It will hide behind the glass and send shockwaves around. Try to get behind
   a pillar or in-between the shockwaves to avoid them.

~~ The chandelier will become possessed and drop from the ceiling. This will
   create a shockwave; jump to avoid it. The chandelier will spin and shoot
   beam of energy. Jump in and attack when possible. Once it is out of HP, use
   the Reaction Command Release to continue.

~~ Now the boss will disappear entirely. Part of the floor will open up, eat
   you, and spit you out. Avoid it by finding the light moving along the floor
   and jumping.

~~ Next, it will possess a set of pillars, making them move around. (Am I the
   only one reminded of "Beetlejuice"?) They can also strike you. The darkest
   of the pillars is your target. Empty its HP gauge and use the Reaction
   Command Release to continue.

This cycle of attacks will continue until you defeat the Shadow Stalker. After
it does, the real boss starts.

The Dark Thorn begins by becoming invisible. Lock-on to it and following it,
striking it when possible. The Step Vault Reaction Command will become usable
at some point; use it to launch up to the chandelier. Then use the Catch and
Pendulum Round Reaction Commands to hurt and visify (I know it isn't a word)
the Dark Thorn. It will soon do this to YOU.

At some other point in the battle, the Dark Thorn may throw you. Use Slingshot,
a Reaction Command, to damage the monster fairly well.

One thing to note, I'd save your Valor form for the Dark Thorn, seeing as it's
harder (to me).

As bonuses, Sora's max HP increases by five and he'll learn Retaliating Slash;
Donald's max HP is upped by four; Goofy gets another item slot; and Beast gets
a whopping HP increase of 35.


After the battle, Sora uses Beast's rose to unlock the path to the next world.
Additionally, Sora will now be able to use Cure.

After completing both Beast's Castle and the Land of Dragons, you'll
automatically be driven to Hollow Bastion. There, you'll find that Merlin,
although having been attacked by the Heartless, has a gift that should be
familiar to KH1 players: the book to the 100 Acre Woods! He'll leave for a bit,
while Sora decides to visit Pooh. Talk to Donald to do just that.

Enter the popped-up area on the page, Pooh Bear's House. Before you talk to
Pooh, open the chests nearby (AP Boost, Mythril Shard, 100 Acre Wood Map). Now,
go and greet Pooh. However, he stops in mid-jump and Sora is rocketed out of
the book.

Outside, Sora is distracted by the Heartless, some of whom grab the book. Give
them a good ol' beating and take back the roughed-up book. Sora will go in to
check on Pooh.

Return to the popped-up area. After talking with Pooh, it seems that Pooh has
complete and utter amnesia. Sora simply leaves.

Outside, Merlin has returned and scolds Sora for being so impatient. As with
KH1, you'll have to find all of the five Torn Pages to the book to finish the
world and grab its treasures. Merlin will give you your first Summoning Charm,
the Baseball Charm, which summons Chicken Little. After this, you are returned
to the world map.

Sora and company seem to have gotten off the Gummi Ship in the wrong place
(that makes twice Sora's messed up with the Gummi Ship). They meet Megara, who
is here to convince Hades to give Hercules a break, because Hades has been
sending up a lot of monsters to the Coliseum, and everyone has their breaking
point. Sora, of course, offers to help, so now to find Hades.

First off, though, go to the Moogle Shop. The primary buys are the Comet Staff
and Falling Star for Donald and Goofy, respectively. A Potions won't hurt,
either. Go past Meg to find the Cave of the Dead.

There, you'll meet one of a few new Heartless, the Rabid Dog. They are the
Shadows of Emblem Heartless; in other words, they're weak and pose little
threat.

In the next area, you'll find a long winding passageway. Once you get to the
fork, go along both paths by going to where they merge and coming back. This
yields four chests: a Hi-Potion, an Ether, an AP Boost, and a Mythril Shard.
At the end of the winding passage, you'll find another chest, in which you'll
find a Mythril Stone. Go to the Inner Chamber.

There, you can use the Save Point and Moogle Shop. Also open the two nearby
chests (Mythril Shard, Underworld Map). Go through the greenish archway to the
Valley of the Dead.

This area mainly consists of three large platforms and narrow bridges
in-between (like the second part of the Omega Ruins of FFX). Each of the
platforms will contain a fight (like the aforementioned). You'll find a new
Heartless there: the Creeper Plant. These, too, are somewhat unthreatening.
They can give you access to the Reaction Command Root Ravager, which will
damage the Plant and nearby enemies. At the end of the platforms, you'll find
Hades' Chamber.

Here, Hades will summon Auron to do some of his dirty work. Auron disagrees
with who he is working for, leading to a fight as Sora and company enter.

So, you are going to fight... or more precisely, run! See, in the Underworld
(Hades' domain), you cannot damage Hades (as it is his domain). Auron will
join your party and you must fight across the Valley of the Dead. During the
chase, you will have to fight all of the enemies before moving on -- and Hades,
in his invincible glory, will attack you, too. Remember, he is invincible, so
don't even waste your time with him. After finishing the third platform, it is
done and Hades will leave... for now.

After the battle, you decide to return to Meg. However, Hades won't let you off
so easily... Return to the entrance of the cave where you'll fight Cerberus,
with just Sora and Auron (Donald and Goofy are always behind that wall for some
reason).

==============
BOSS: Cerberus
==============

The battle begins with Cerberus jumping and causing a shockwave. This shockwave
can be jumped over, although it's a bit tougher if Cerberus decides to jump on
you. This is a common attack.

Cerberus may spin around and hit with its tail. It is rather hard to predict,
but it fairly rare.

It may also spit up dark balls of energy to rain down upon you. They rain
slowly.

Another useful attack for you is when it slams its two outer heads into the
middle one. You actually want to jump INTO the attack to use some Reaction
Commands that will do some damage and stun it for a while.

The basic strategy is just to wail on it and heal when needed.

After the battle, Sora learns the Dodge Slash ability; Auron's max HP increases
by 40.


After the battle, return to the Underworld Entrance, use the Save Point and
shop, then go up to the Coliseum Gates. Herc arrives, exhausted, but composes
himself upon seeing Sora. He decides to give Sora a stone that'll protect him
from the curse of the Underworld, but he has a match, so you'll train with
Phil for a while. You'll be given a Coliseum Map.

Go into the Coliseum and talk to Phil. He'll give you two training courses,
one after the other.

For the first one, you have 90 seconds to get 20 orbs from the pots. To break
a pot and get the orbs, you must hit it with the finishing move of a combo. I
need not mention more, seeing as one can do it with their eyes closed, which I
have.

As for the second one, you have to collect 100 orbs in ninety seconds. It has
the same general rules as before. It helps to go after the larger pots and the
groups. For finishing this course, Sora will get the Aerial Spiral ability.

After training, talk to Herc. It seems that the Olympus Stone -- the stone that
protects the holder from the curse of the Underworld -- has been stolen. It is
a good guess that Organization XIII is behind this. Hades appears and lets slip
that he kidnapped Meg. He then sends the Hydra to fight Herc, so now Sora has
to get the Olympus Stone and find Meg.

Return to the Underworld Entrance to find the flames in front of the pathway to
the east have been extinguished. The chest near where the flames used to be
contains a Power Boost. Continue forward to the Underworld Caverns.

There, go forward a bit to fall through the fog. You'll find a new Heartless
here, the Trick Ghost. They aren't much worth mentioning except for their long
range attack. Right after falling, grab the Mythril Shard from the chest. Head
on to the next area, the Lost Road.

The Lost Road is more of a maze, so be careful when fighting. When you get to
the first large area, the chest to the right contains an Ether. This room has
three paths leading away, the left being where you came from. Go down the
middle path to find a chest with a Hi-Potion. The door to the right returns you
to the Entrance area, on a different platform. Go through it to get a Hi-Potion
and AP Boost from two chests, then return to the Lost Road. Go left to another
open area. The nearby chest will contain a Mythril Stone. Take the middle path
of the three out of here. Go to the back wall and around the curve to find a
chest (Mythril Shard). Continue along to find a door to the next area; go
through it.

Go to the right to find a Tent in the chest. Next, go up the ramp. Before going
to the next area, jump to the platform to the right to find an AP Boost inside
a chest.

Before you can go any further, the man in the black coat will appear and take
off his hood. This is Demyx, the least aggressive and laziest member of
Organization XIII. He does have two advantages over you: the Olympus Stone and
the ability to create water clones of himself.

===============
MINIBOSS: Demyx
===============

As I said earlier, Demyx can create water clones of himself. He will be doing
that for this battle. You have to defeat 100 of them in 80 seconds.

At first, you'll think it'll be easy, since each clone has low HP and takes
just two or three hits to finish it. However, you have to defeat 1.25 each
second, so just attacking won't work. Instead, abuse the Reaction Command
Wild Dance to wipe out many clones. If you beat all 100 in the time limit,
you've won.

For winning, Sora's max HP increases by 5; Donald learns MP Rage; and Goofy's
max HP increases by five.


After the battle, you'll get the Olympus Stone and Secret Ansem's Report #5.
Since you have the Olympus Stone, you can now use Summons and Drive Forms in
the Underworld. When ready, continue through the doors.

In The Lock area, open the three chests (AP Boost, Mythril Shard, Caverns Map).
Use the Save Point, then inspect the thing in the middle. After the scene, go
into the beam of light.

Pete will appear and send a bunch of Hook Bats after you. While defeating them,
keep in mind you have to defend Meg, too. If her damage gauge gets too high,
you'll lose. You still have to fight Pete, who has some weak attacks and may
summon Shadows. It is pretty basic, I guess.

After the battle fades out. Sora will unbind Meg and Hercules will come in.
Meg will leave on Pegasus and then you'll fight Pete.

==========
BOSS: Pete
==========

You have two minutes to do this, before the cave collapses, so be quick with
this.

Remember earlier when Pete would lift up his shield and you couldn't hit him?
With Hercules nearby, you can use the Pinball Reaction Command to break it.
Other than that, you can also use the Aura Guard Reaction Command to protect
yourself when Pete summons that giant rock to fall on Sora. Other than that,
it is still fairly basic: just wail on him.

For winning, Sora will learn Trinity Limit; Donald's max HP increases by four;
and Goofy learns Hyper Healing.


Back at the Entrance, Hades comes and reminds Herc of the Hydra he left alive.
It wasn't actually defeated, and is now making a fair mess of things. Use the
Save Point and shop, then go to the Coliseum Gates for this world's boss.

===========
BOSS: Hydra
===========

As with the usual mythology, the Hydra will start with one head. During this
time, watch for tail sweeps and lightning balls. Just dodge attacks and the
head will eventually come close to the ground; when it does, wail on it. After
some HP is gone, the head will rock back into the air. You can now use the
Vanquish Reaction Command to chop the head off.

And, as with usual mythology, more heads grow.

During this phase, three heads will come out of the ground (anyone thinking of
God of War right now?) to attack individually. As before, deplete HP for a head
and chop it off. Phil may also tell to get onto the Hydra's back (it's easy to
know when) and you'll be able to use the Phil One-Two Reaction Command in
conjuction with the Urninator (creative...) Command to stun the heads. Continue
hacking.

Once all of the heads are gone, it'll come out the ground -- headless for a few
seconds, haha -- and sprout the famed seven heads. For the most part, you'll be
avoiding the heads' swinging attacks and the black gas/spirit/things. Once it
calms some and begins to look around, deal as damage to it as you can. Valor is
always a good option. If you need some orbs, go to the east wall to find Meg,
who'll throw you HP/MP/Drive Orbs.

At one point, Pegasus Run will become a Reaction Command. Use it to be picked
up by Pegasus and fly in front of the heads, using the Reaction Command Attacl
to deal damage.

Once all of the HP is gone, use Vanquish to finish the battle.

As a bonus, Sora can now use Thunder and gets five extra HP; Donald gets an
extra Armor slot; and Goofy also gets five extra HP.


After scene, in which Sora unlocks a new road, he'll get the Hero's Crest, a
Keyblade. Since trouble is brewing at Disney Castle, that is where you'll go
next. There isn't a Gummi Level for this one.

After landing in the Gummi Hangar, Chip and Dale will tell you to go find Queen
Minnie, who is in the Library. Exit the Hangar to go to the Courtyard. There,
you'll encounter the new Heartless for this world, the Minute Bomb. They will
begin a countdown when they are struck; when it hits zero, the Heartless
explodes. The Reaction Command Dodge Roll will let you avoid this, and even
damage other Heartless.

We'll begin from where you left the Hangar. Go straight across to the
perimeter. In the general area around the perimeter, you'll find these items in
chests in this order, going clockwise: Ether, AP Boost, Mythril Shard, Mythril
Shard, and a Mythril Stone. Then go behind the miidle platform to find a
Hi-Potion and go on top of the middle platform for the Star Recipe. Head into
the Colonnade now by going through the door behind the pig-shaped hedge.

There, you'll face many, many Shadows. They can add up to decent EXP. and may
help you with the Valor form leveling. When you're ready, go to the door on
the opposite ned of the hall.

Inside the Library, open the final chest for this world (Torn Pages). You can
use the nearby Moogle shop (buy some Dark Anklets, if possible) and use the
nearby Save Point. When ready, talk to Queen Minnie. Donald and Goofy leave to
tell of the rest of the castle of the danger, while you escort Queen Minnie to
the audience chamber. At this point, you'll recieve the Disney Castle Map.

Back in the Colonnade, you'll be protecting Queen Minnie from the Heartless as
you slowly make your way to the audience chamber. Simply fight the Heartless as
you go, and use the Call Reaction Command to call the Queen forward. If you get
in trouble, stand near her and use the Faith Reaction Command. Once you get to
the huge purplish door, use the Finish Reaction Command.

Inside, despite the fact that Queen Minnie sealed the room, Heartless got in
anyhow. And they are all Bolt Towers, which raises some questions. Like before,
you'll have to escort the Queen to the other side of the room to the throne.
As before, you'll have to use the Call Reaction Command to get Queen Minnie to
follow you, and the Faith Reaction Command will knock the enemies back. When
you get to the throne, use the Finish Reaction Command to continue on and get
Sora another accessory slot.

Sora follows Minnie down into the now-revealed Hall of the Cornerstone. It is
soon becomes apparent Maleficent has caused this invasion of the Heartless and
endangering of the Conrerstone of Light. You'll have to fly the Gummi Ship back
to Merlin in Hollow Bastion and see if he can help; use the Save Point to go
back to the Gummi Ship.

After returning with Merlin to Disney Castle, it seems Merlin knows the problem
and makes a door for you to go through. The goal is simple: go into the new
world, find the perpetrator, and seal the other door. When ready, go through
the door to the Timeless River.

As you arrive in this world, it's obvious everything has become different.
Obviously, it's in a black-and-white world. Additionally, the looks of everyone
has changed and so has the sound quality. It's a nice change.

In the first area, use the shop. It isn't a bad idea to buy Donald some Gold
Rings, as they increase magic, and Sora and Goofy some Tourmaline Rings. In the
area nearby, there will be two chests, just to the right of the Moogle Shop.
They contain a Drive Recovery and a Cornerstone Hill Map. Now, exit to the
south to the pier.

In front of you, you'll find a tree. Underneath said tree is a chest in which
you'll find a Hi-Potion. Farther left, you'll find another chest, in which is a
Mythril Shard. Now approach Pete at the docks and use the Reaction Command
Punish.

The fight itself isn't very difficult. He'll run around and punch or run around
madly (which triggers the Reaction Command About Face). After thoroughly
roughing up Pete, the team will realize that this is not the Pete they're
looking for, and apologize.

When you return to Cornerstone Hill, the team will see what happened just
before they entered through the door. It seems a few doors in this area used
to go to other parts of the world and Heartless went through these doors. They
find these doors upon turning around. So, before helping Pete or finishing his
original goal, Sora must finish off these Heartless.

Now, you can go through the doors and finish the scenarios in whichever order
you please. For the walkthrough, I'll go left to right.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FARTHEST LEFT DOOR: Building Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, you'll be on a scaffolding fighting Heartless, primarily Minute Bombs
and a new Heartless variety, the Hammer Frame. You'll have to beat all of the
Heartless before the scaffolding falls down. After some time, the scaffolding
will shake, bouncing the party up and down. Try to defeat enemies while this
is happening to the best of your ability.

After this scenario, you are given the first of four scenes that hint at what
Timeless River is and what has been plaguing it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SECOND DOOR FROM LEFT: Lilliput
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Lilliput, you'll find a tiny town centered around a tower. Among the
Heartless you'll fight here, you'll encounter the Aeroplane, which is a goofy
Heartless. It is fairly weak. During the battle, you'll have to prevent the
town from taking too much damage, represented by the gauge in the corner. As an
aid, you can go near the tower to use the Stomp Bomb Reaction Command, which
will shoot at the enemies.

After this, you'll be given the second of four scenes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SECOND DOOR FROM RIGHT: Scene of the Fire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this hardest of the scenarios, you'll be fighting another new Heartless, the
ever-so-annoying Hot Rod. They enjoy speeding towards you when they have low
HP. This charge attack also makes them temporarily invincible.

During the battle, fireballs will appear and send some smaller ones at the
building. You may destroy these to prevent the building from taking too much
damage, but try to stay focused on the Heartless. The initial enemy wave
consists of Shadows, followed by a second wave of two Hot Rods. Valor form is
a good idea against these enemies.

After the battle, you'll get the third of four scenes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FARTHEST RIGHT DOOR: Mickey's House
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the final door, you'll find Mickey's House, which is being tarnished by a
floating vacuum in the center of the room, and not your standard vacuum
cleaner. Before time runs out, you'll have to simply defeat some Rapid
Thrusters. Probably the easiest of them all.

After the battle, you'll get the final of the four scenes.


After all four scenarios, you'll receive the Window of Time Map. Use the nearby
Save Point and Moogle Shop. Now, chase after Pete; he exited to the Waterway in
the northeast.

Now, the future evil Pete has stolen the Cornerstone of Light and the past
Pete's steamboat. Obviously, you can't reach him all the way in the water, but
you certainly are fully able to use Reaction Commands to knock the junk evil
Pete throws at you back at him, possibly knocking him unconscious. Once he is,
he'll be spun to the shore. When he does so, go over to the boat, grab onto the
hook, and bash away at the cage. Be sure to use the Reaction Command to hang
on; otherwise, you'll drop off and fight a few Heartless. The battle ends when
the cage is opened.

As a bonus, Sora learns Slapshot; Donald learns Fantasia and Auto-Limit; Goofy
has his max HP increased by 5.

After the battle, you can grab the items in the area. Near the windmill is a
chest (Hi-Potion). Near the cage is the last chest (AP Boost). You may return
to Cornerstone Hill and use the Save Point and Moogle Shop. When ready, go to
the Wharf. There, you'll encounter past and future Pete, the former who'll
help you fight the latter.

==========
BOSS: Pete
==========

Pete is more of a defensive fighter than an offensive fighter. He can throw a
lot of exploding balls, which, like most of his attacks, are difficult to break
through. It is best to approach from the side.

After some time, Pete will switch the scene to one of the four scenarios' areas
from earlier.

In the Scene of the Fire area, beware of the fireballs. In Mickey's House, the
vortex can complicate things a bit. In the Lilliput, the cannons will shoot at
you. In the Building Site, the scaffolding will bounce everyone up and down,
which does make the Air Slash Reaction Command available, which deals a large
amount of damage.

For winning, Sora learns Reflect and has his max HP upped by 5; Donald's max
HP is increased by four; and Goofy learns Goofy Tornado.


After the battle, Pete (future) will leave this world by using the door to
Hollow Bastion, which you came to seal and promptly do. The past Pate will
bring the Cornerstone of Light back to the field, setting things in Disney
Castle to their proper working order. You'll also receive the Monochrome,
a Keybalde, for Sora. The Cornerstone will then reveal the path to two new
areas.

You'll also be allowed to use the Wisdom Drive Form, and a tournament cup is
unlocked at the Coliseum.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please note that Section X deals with the 100 Acre Wood episode you can do
because of the Torn Pages from earlier and that Section XI deals with the
tournament at Olympus. Section XII deals with Atlantica, also another optional
world. If you do not wish to do any of these, continue on to Section XIII,
which deals with Port Royal.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this, return to Hollow Bastion and examine the book in Merlin's House with
a Torn Pages in your inventory.

When you enter the book, the Torn Pages will reassert themselves with the book,
revealing the next area: Piglet's House. Head there and open the three chests
in the area (AP Boost, Defense Boost, Mythril Gem).

Once you're ready, go over to Piglet to rescue him. A gust of wind will
promptly send him flying off, and then Sora has rescue him by holding on to a
balloon. Pooh comes too.

This initiates a minigame called "A Blustery Rescue". Sora and Pooh will be
riding on a balloon in a side-scrolling area. Objects will try to the two of
you, but you can protect yourself by hitting these objects. Additionally, you
can use the Reaction Command Whirlwind when inside a whirlwind to destroy most
of the on-screen objects. Also, Pooh will begin to free-fall if you're hit;
get near him and use the Reaction Command to rescue him. Do the same for
Piglet at the end.

After you're done, you can head to Olympus Coliseum for the tournament, to
Atlantica for the extra world, or Port Royal to get the game over with.

For now, when you land, obviously no Heartless or Nobodies are messing around.
We are here for the tournament. Use the nearby Save Point and Shop, then talk
to Panic, the blue skinny guy, to enter the tournament.

The Pain & Panic Cup has a restriction: you cannot use Drive Forms. Your Limits
will use less MP (dramatically less) MP than usual. However, still be careful
about them: the charge can take several battles to fill.

O==============================O---------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #8  |  ENEMIES: Rapid Thruster (x [a lot])  |
O==============================O---------------------------------------O

You're alone for this fight, and you only fight for a minute, like at the Land
of Dragons. Just survive.


O==============================O----------------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #9  |  ENEMIES: Gargoyle Knight (x2),              |
|                              |           Creeper Plant (x4)                 |
O==============================O----------------------------------------------O

A fairly basic fight. Not worth wasting a Limit.


O===============================O----------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #10  |  ENEMIES: Leon and Yuffie  |
O===============================O----------------------------O

I prefer to take out Yuffie first, because she can get annoying with her long
range attack and she is fast. Leon isn't as much trouble, except for when his
Gunblade gets to a much longer length. I think he can also shoot fireballs. It
is still a somewhat easy fight, but Limits are a big help.


For winning this tournament, you'll get the Lucky Ring and a Serenity Stone.

From here, you can either do the 100 Acre Wood thing (Section X), do the
Atlantica episode (Section XII), or go to Port Royal (Section XIII).

|  Undersea Kingdom Map ............................................... []  |
|___________________________________________________________________________|

When you land, it seems Sora forgot how to swim in his one-year nap, so you are
given an explanation. It is different from KH1, as you don't battle here. The
Right Analog Stick controls vertical/up-down movement while the Left Analog
Stick controls horizontal/left-right-forward-back movement. X will let you
swim faster, and pressing Circle while locked-on will take you to the target.
Begin by talking to Flounder. Sebastian will soon ask Sora to be in the concert
coming up soon. Sora accepts.

In the tutorial, you'll simply hit X when the blue circular bar is in the
orange and yellow areas (yellow is preferred). If you mess up the timing, it is
a BAD; orange is GOOD; yellow is EXCELLENT. After finishing the tutorial, you
will get the Undersea Kingdom Map.

When ready, talk to Sebastian to begin the musical. Don't try to hit START, or
you'll be forced to start over.

The musical is barely different from the tutorial. You'll get a music note at
the top of the screen for each EXCELLENT you get; GOODs do nothing and BADs
subtract a note. You'll have to have one note by the end to win.

Even after the musical, Ariel is still distracted with the world above, so
Flounder tells and shows Sora something he things she would like. However, it
is a (metal) statue buried under heavy wreckage.

      ~~~~~ To continue this world, return with the Magnet spell. ~~~~~

Now, you can either do the 100 Acre Wood episode (Section X), the Olympus
Coliseum tournament (Section XI), or Port Royal (Section XIII).

When you first land in the Rampart, look around the three chests in the area.
They contain an Ether, a Mythril Stone, and the Naval Map. Use the shop and the
Save Point, then go down the stairs near the chest that contained the map.
At their bottom, you'll find Pete discussing matters with Captain Barbossa.
When you arrive, Barbossa sics four of his Undead Pirates on you. In the
battle, you'll notice that you cannot hit them. Attempt enough attacks to
trigger the next cutscene.

After the scene, the moon is now uncovered, letting you hit the Pirates. As
with any enemy, simply wail on them. The Reaction Command Return Fire may
speed things up. Also, magic can affect these pirates: Fire makes them run
around in a panic; Blizzard freezes them in place; Thunder causes them to move
slowly. Magic also deals some decent damage.

After the battle, head across the bridge into the town. There, you'll meet
Elizabeth and Will, two people being tormented by the Heartless, which Sora
promptly decides to the rid them of. You'll fight some Soldiers and Shadows, as
well as a new Heartless: the Cannon Gun. These Heartless tend to stay out of
the fray, trying to shoot bombs at you. The target for the bomb is seen as the
very obvious target.

After the battle, let's grab some treasure. Immediately after the cutscene, go
forward to the junk pile and take a right. Near the end of that alley, you'll
find a chest, in which you'll find a Mythril Shard. Return to the beginning of
the alley and bash the two explosive devices on either side you of. One will
lead you to a small alcove with a chest (AP Boost); the other will go to a
different area. Go there and hack away at the nearby explosives to reveal
another chest (Mythril Hem). Go to the right of the opening to find yet another
chest (Ether). Now, go to the Harbor. There, you'll meet the famed Captain Jack
Sparrow, who will also become a party member.

When you are ready, speak with Will. You'll board the Interceptor to try to
rescue Elizabeth. Once aboard, head down into the hold to find a Save Point and
the Moogle Shop. There, buy a Victory Bell for Donald and the Chain Gear for
Goofy. Stock up on some more restorative items, and, when ready, go onto the
deck.

There, talk to Jack and select to go for the Black Pearl. As you go there, you
will be waylaid by some Undead Pirates, as well as the Heartless Air Pirates.
These new Heartless are worth little mention, except they enjoy flying around.
After beating them, you'll land at Isle de Muerta, where you are assigned to
watch the ship while Jack and Will take off on their own. Sora eventually gets
bored, and goes to check on Jack and Will. Use the Save Point and head north to
the Cave Mouth.

In this area, you'll find a few chests, in which you'll find an Ether and a
Mythril Shard. Continue further north to find Will and Elizabeth -- no sign of
Jack -- retreating. You'll hold off the Undead Pirates for one minutes, whether
you decide to actually fight or not. To hit them, as on the ship, you'll have
to lure them somehow into the moonlight. After the minute is up, you'll head
back to the Interceptor. It is then explained why Jack is still on the island.
You'll get the Isle de Muerta Map after the cutscene.

Will decides to sail back to the Harbor. As before, on the way there, you'll be
waylaid by the Undead Pirates. And, as before, to defeat them, you'll have to
first lure them into the moonlight.

Before reaching the Harbor, the Black Pearl will catch up with you. In the
battle following the cutscene, you'll fight several waves of Undead Pirates
while protecting the Medallion. If a Pirate takes away the Medallion, you'll
have precisely one minute to defeat the thieving Pirate so as to make him
drop it; otherwise, it is a game over. The thieving Pirate is made obvious by
the speech bubble. Also, during the battle, you'll be shot at by the Black
Pearl. The cannon targets are shown by light blue rings, similar to how the
Cannon Gun operates.

After the battle, Sora's max HP increase by five; Donald learns Draw; and
Goofy's max HP is upped by five.

After a few scenes, Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jack have to remove the five
explosives from the ship so that they and Elizabeth aren't blown to pieces.
As I said before, there are five explosives in the form of burning barrels at
the top of the screen and in the field. When you find one, you'll need to use
a Reaction Command to launch the barrel off the ship. Air Pirates will also
antagonize you, but ignore them and concentrate on basic survival. There will
be in front of you from the start; the other two are on the upper part of the
deck behind you.

For winning this battle, Sora gets another item slot; Donald's max HP is upped
by four; Goofy learns Second Chance; and Jack's max HP increases by 10.

After the battle, you'll have to return to the Isle de Muerta. There, when you
disembark from the ship, head north to reach the Powder Store. As in the town,
you'll find explosive boxes here that may reveal a chest when they are gone.
The first on your left automatically explodes, revealing an Undead Pirate and
a chest (AP Boost). The next pair of boxes also explode by themselves, which
reveals two more Undead Pirates. The last explosive has a chest behind it, in
which you'll find an AP Boost.

In the next area, the Moonlight Nook, you'll still fight some Undead Pirates.
However, the only moonlight in which you can hit them is in the center of the
area, which basically means you'll virtually always knock them back into the
shadows. It helps to freeze them with Blizzard magic or perhaps a Limit.
Regardless of your chosen method, after the battle, grab the three nearby
chests (Ether, Mega-Potion, Mythril Shard). After that, head north.

Luckily for you, in the cutscene, you'll take out the pirates, meaning you are
sped straight to the boss fight.

======================================
BOSS: Captain Barbossa and Illuminator
======================================

When the fight starts, the room will be darkened drastically, thanks to the
Illuminator. While it is like this, Barbossa cannot be hurt (he is also an
Undead Pirate, remember? And there is no moonlight.). Instead, focus on the
Illuminator. You'll notice it by the glowing eyes. Run over to it and hit it
a few times: its HP is fairly low.

After defeating the Illuminator, the area will light up some. This will give
you the chance to damage Barbossa (assuming he isn't in one of those small
dark patches of shadow). He typically fights with his sword, although he can
use his gun and some bombs to send Sora flying. Valor form is a good choice
for speeding this up, although Wisdom form lets you get damaged less.

Near the end, Barbossa gets more brutal with his attacks, which opens a few
Reaction Commands. When Barbossa begins to wildly swing his sword, use Land to
trap his sword, and then Reverse Blade to smack him, sending him flying and
dealing a good chunk of damage. Twin Counter may also be used while Jack is
near. This swings Barbossa up into the air, opening up Sonic Dive, to send Sora
after Barbossa.

After the battle, Sora will learn Aerial Finish and have Drive Gauge max upped
by one; Donald's max HP increases by four; Goofy learns Teamwork and
Auto-Limit; and Jack's max HP increases by 15.


After the battle, Sora will use Jack's compass to open the path to the next
two worlds, Agrabah and Halloween Town. As with the Land of Dragons and Beast's
Castle, I'll cover them in the order I usually play. Agrabah will be in
Section XIV; Halloween Town is in Section XV.

Also, Sora receives the Follow the Wind Keyblade.

Immediately after landing, Iago shows up, offering his apologies, but some
Heartless attack soon after. The new Heartless in this battle are Luna Bandits,
and they are annoying in numbers, especially with their knockdown attack. Some
Shadows are also here. After fighting several waves (Valor form is a good idea)
a scene occurs, in which Iago inadvertently saves the team, who soon run into a
small room. You'll recieve the Argabah Map after the scene.

Inside the room, you can use the Moogle Shop (Fira/Blizzara accessories are
recommended for the eventual boss; Aegis Chains are even better) and the Save
Point. When you're ready, exit out to Agrabah.

For the moment, there are no enemies in this area, so let's go treasure
hunting. From where Goofy is standing, turn around and head up the stairs to
find a Hi-Potion inside a chest. To the right, you'll find another chest, in
which is a Mythril Shard. Do a 180 and go to the other side of the area, where
you'll find a Drive Recovery insdie a chest. Go left and jump onto the ledge.
Atop the higher building, go left for a chest (Mythril Stone) and right for
another chest (Mythril Shard). From the Mythril Shard chest, go left and fall
into the enclosed area to find yet another chest, in which you'll find an AP
Boost. Turn around and jump back onto the higher ledge, then look straight
across the lower area in front of you. The chest in this area that you have to
jump up to get contains a Mega-Ether. Finally, when you are ready, exit to the
north, towards the Palace.

There, after the scene with Jasmine, you'll soon run into Aladdin and Abu
stealing from the Peddler. They soon realize that the black lamp that the
Peddler owns is the very same one that Jafar was banished into in their journey
one year ago (KH1). Enemies now appear in the area, one of which is new to you:
the Silver Rock. They like to disappear and create explosions upon reappearing.
While they're still in a light form, use the Reaction Command Shift Shot to
virtually kill them. When ready, go to the small room from earlier, on the east
side, which happens to be the Peddler's Shop.

After the scene, in which Donald makes a slip-up, you must now bring the
Peddler something fit for a sultan if you wish to have to the lamp. They cannot
get something from the Palace, so the Cave of Wonders is their second choice.
To start, exit to the southeast to reach the Bazaar.

Here, you'll fight a new Heartless (assuming you haven't played another KH):
the Fat Bandit. Like the Large Bodies, they cannot be physically damaged from
the front, only the back (magic can be used). Also like Large Bodies, after a
combo, you can use the Reaction Commands Full Swing and Kickback. They tend to
attack with fire-based attack (the fireballs can be reflected). After clearing
the area, you can grab the chests. The single chest is the higher part of the
Bazaar contains a Mythril Gem. As for the others, you'll have to burn away
most, if not all, of the stands with Fire (or physically use combos). The
four chests in the lower area contain two Hi-Potions, an AP Boost, and a
Mythril Shard. Once ready, exit to the south to the Palace Walls area.

To your left, you'll find a Save Point. Farther to the left will be another
chest, in which you'll find a Mythril Stone. The big chest in the area contains
the accessory called the Skill Ring. Once ready, exit to the south to find the
Cave of Wonders. Go behind its head to find two chests (Drive Recovery, Mythril
Shard). Go through the mouth to enter the Cave.

In the Cave of Wonders, you'll find three new Heartless. Fiery Globes and Icy
Cubes are mostly used to annoy you and are weak (one-two hits kills them), even
in numbers. As for the Fortunetellers, they can fly around and use some ice
attacks. They aren't particularly dangerous until you fight them in groups of
enemies. Anywho, in the first area, you'll find four chests which contain, from
entrance to exit, a Hi-Potion, a Mythril Shard, a Mythril Stone, and an AP
Boost. When you're ready, exit to the next area.

There, examine the floating jewel and head to the statue at the other side of
the cave and examine it. Abu will grab the jewel, which causes falling ice,
waves of water, and ice attacks to hit you and Abu. Guide Abu to the end by
calling him over with Triangle. It's fiarly simple: just set Abu in motion when
you jump over a wave to have Abu do the same thing.

For doing this, Sora's max HP is increased by five; Donald learns Donald
Blizzard; Goofy's max HP increases by five; Aladdin's max HP is upped by 15.

After the event, the statue at the disappears, which let's you go through. It
also makes a Save Point; use it if needed, then go through the hole the statue
revealed.

Examine and activate the object in the middle of the platform to set an event
in motion. It is a set of timed battles. Overall, you have two minutes to
defeat all of the Heartless at each of the platforms. As you go, the Heartless
will come in larger, more powerful groups (and the falls get longer). The main
problem is the Fat Bandits. I believe that Wisdom form will allow the regular
Attack to hit from the front so, if you have trouble with Fat Bandits, then
Wisdom form would be optimal for this; otherwise, I'd use nothing (or Valor if
you are too low a level). After the basttle, you can use the nearby Save Point
and even use the nearby teleporter to return to the top to do this again. There
are two chests in front of the door (AP Boost, Cave of Wonders Map). Exmaine
the object in the center of the platform to open the door. Go through it.

In the next room, during the cutscene, Pete sics some Heartless (fifty to be
precise) on you. The first 47 of them are easy: they are just Silver Rocks,
Icy Cubes, and Fiery Globes (all easy EXP. for Wisdom form). As for the last
three, three Fat Bandits, I recommend Limits, magic, or Wisdom form. All are
good ways to deal with them.

After the battle, Sora's max HP will increase by five; Donald's max HP
increases by four; Goofy learns Auto Healing; and Aladdin's max HP increases
by fifteen.

(Also, two chests are in this room, but can only be obtained after the next
cutscene. They chests contain an AP Boost and a Serenity Shard.)

After the battle, you are automatically put back in Agrabah, where Pete is
giving the Peddler some trouble. After that scene, head to the Palace to fight
the boss.

=====================================
BOSS: Volcanic Lord and Blizzard Lord
=====================================

Despite there being two large Heartless, this is actually fairly easy. For the
first thing, they each are vulnerable to a certain element: the Volcanic Lord
is weak against Blizzard-based spells; the Blizzard Lord is weak against
Fire-based spells. Also, when they bounce around, you use the Reaction Command
Firegun (on the Volcanic Lord) or Blizzagun (on the Blizzard Lord) to send it
spinning around, then flying into the other, dealing some decent damage.

Also, another thing, they may apart into Fiery Globes (in the case of the
Volcanic Lord) or Icy Cubes (in the case of the Blizzard Lord). Go ahead and
take care of them. Also, they may eventually cast magic, explemified by their
staff motions.

After the battle, Sora learns Explosion; Donald's max HP is upped by four;
Goofy gets another armor slot; and Aladdin's max HP is upped by 15.


After the battle, Sora will use the jewel that Abu took from the Cave of
Wonders to open the path to another world. Additionally, you get the Lamp Charm
(which lets you summon Genies) and be allowed to go to Twilight Town.

So, from here, you can either go to Halloween Town (Section XV), the Pride
Lands (Section XVII), or Twilight Town (Section XIX). The others in-between
some of these cannot be dealt with until other conditions are met in these
next worlds.

After landing Halloween Town, the team (as well as you, probably) are surprised
to see Halloween Town decorated in orange Christmas lights. In the area in
which you landed, you can open the two chests to get a Hi-Potion and a Mythril
Shard. After that, follow Zero into town. Jack (Skellington, not Sparrow) will
reveal that plans to carry out both Halloween and Christmas this year, then
follows up by telling the team to follow him to see Sally. Sora hears that Jack
is going to Santa, and he can't control himself.

Since you're in the lab, open the chest to get a Halloween Town Map, then go
out into the Halloween Town Square. The Wight Knights are here, of course, and
they like to block your attacks, of course. They appear alongside some Shadows
and Soldiers. You can also mess with some of the local items, the fountains,
the vents, and the guillotine.

After the battle, raid the Square for two chests. Near the entrance Jack's
house, you'll find a chest, in which you'll find a Mythril Stone. Near the
guillotine, you'll find the second chest (Mega-Potion). Now, return to the
Graveyard. You can fight some enemies, one of which is the new Heartless
variety, the Driller Mole, and then head into the Hinterlands.

Alongside the left side, you'll find two chests (Hi-Potion, Mythril Stone) and
on the right, you'll find one chest (AP Boost). Next, go through the door into
Christmas Town. After the scene, use the Save Point and Moogle Shop, then exit
to the south.

In this area, you'll find another new enemy, the Toy Soldier. They have a fair
amount of HP and Defense. It can hack at you with some knives, or shoot you
from a distance. You can use the nearby carousel to damage enemies by using a
Reaction Command to spin it around. Anywho, after dealing with the enemies, go
around the area treasure hunting. Next to the big green doors is an Ether. On
low roofs in front of the houses, you'll find two chests (Hi-Potion, Mythril
Gem). Finally, next to the door into Santa's House, you'll find another chest
(Mythril Stone). When you're ready, enter Santa's House.

In the scene, Santa will go off to see what caused the commotion in the other
room. While he does, open the two chests for an AP Boost an a Christmas Town
Map. After opening the chests, follow Santa into the next room. Now, you'll
have to follow Lock, Shock, and Barrel. All you must do is follow the
footprints left by the bathtub to Curly Hill, accessible from the Graveyard in
Halloween Town. You'll then fight the Prison Keeper.

===================
BOSS: Prison Keeper
===================

The Prison Keeper will actually change how it fights depending on who it
swallowes. You may want to, as well.

When Lock is swallowed, the Prison Keeper can throw giant balls of energy at
you. They are slow, though, and can be easily reflected with Guard, which will
also do some good damage. However, beware of getting too close: it can use a
wide sweeping attack which is tough to avoid.

When Shock is swallowed, it can float up high and energy from its fingertips.
When this happens, go on top of the curly hill and jump to reach. If you hit it
with a full combo, it will lower back to the ground. It can spin around and
breathe fire while on the ground.

When Barrel is swallowed, it will simply get in your face with a lot of
physical attacks. You should probably wildly swing as well.

One thing to note is that, when it is trying to swallow of the kids, you can
get close to it and use the Reaction Command Inside Combo to get into its
mouth, stun it, and deal some damage. This is a one-time thing, though.

After some time, it'll swallow all three kids, in which it can uses its full
arsenal of attacks. Limits, Summons, and Valor form all are good to deal with
this part of the battle.

After the battle, Sora's max HP increases by five; Donald learns Hyper Healing;
Goofy's max HP increases by five; and Jack's max HP increases by fifteen.


After the battle, Sally will come, telling the team that Oogie Boogie has
kidnapped Santa. Return to Christmas Town and enter the Toy Factory of Santa's
House. Apparently, Maleficent is beyond controlling one's memory, but you'll
still have to fight Oogie.

==================
BOSS: Oogie Boogie
==================

Oogie will start on a glass lift, while you and the gang start on conveyor
belts moving toward a wall of spikes.

At the start, you'll find presents exiting onto the conveyors belts. Use the
Reaction Commands to hit them to Oogie. While you do this, he'll toss exploding
dice to you, or use a giant boxing glove.

Eventually, when the lift is weighted down by too many presents, the lift will
shatter and Oogie will fall down. Pull off some combos on him, quick. He'll
soon return to his lift and the conveyor will run rapidly for a bit; jump to
avoid being spiked.

As the battle wears on, Oogie will start giving you Oogies gifts, which are
differently colored and may contain Heartless. Your partners will usually take
care of the Heartless themselves; instead, focus on breaking the lift.

From time to time, the lift will move to a different conveyor belt. When that
happens, go up to the hole in the wall and wait for the Reaction Command that
says it will move you to the conveyor bely Oogie is on.

Near the end, Oogie will start to use some lightning attacks. They aren't
really worth mentioning, as they're easy to dodge.

For winning, Sora will get another item slot; Donald's max HP will increase by
four; Goofy will learn Once More; and Jack's max HP will increase by 15.


After the battle, Jack comes to his senses and leaves, but not before having
his clothes used to unlock the path to the next world. Sora will also learn
Magnet.

From here, you can either do Agrabah (Section XIV), the Pride Lands (if you
already done Agrabah) (Section XVII), or Atlantica (Section XVI).

   [There are no items, and all other stuff on the tables, for this visit.]

Remember, for this visit, you need at least Magnet (or some variation thereof).
When you do have it, talk to Flounder and tell him that you want to move the
statue for Ariel. This puts you into another musical.

For this one, it is like the last one. You are still paying attention to the
gauge -- you want five or more EXCELLENTS in a row -- but you also have to
notice whether it is Triangle or X you're pressing. Remember, you must have
gotten five EXCELLENTS in a row to pass. If there are multiple prompts on the
screen, you'll get that many EXCELLENTS if you get EXCELLENT.

After this, Sebastian will show Sora a song which he cannot understand. So,
we're off.

       ~~~~~ You'll need a Drive Gauge of 5, 6, or 7 to continue. ~~~~~

Now, you can either go to Agrabah (Section XIV), or the Pride Lands
(Section XVIII).

When you land in the Pride Lands, you'll notice something that is VERY
different. Species-change different. For this world, Sora will be a lion cub,
Donald will be a (flying) bird, and Goofy will be a turtle. Sora's form allows
some new abilities, faster movement, lower jumps, and no Drives or Limits,
except for one later on.

Anyways, in the area where you landed, open the chests (Ether, Mythril Stone,
Savannah Map), then leave by going east. There, in the next area, you'll have
to save Nala from some Heartless. They are new, and of the Living Bone variety.
They have a large amount of HP and easily can corner you. It does let you use
two Reaction Commands: Rodeo (to ride it and deal damage) and Grand Cross (even
more damage).

After defeating the Heartless, let's grab the chests in the Elephant Graveyard.
From the start, go straight to find one chest (Hi-Potion). Now, turn around and
go up the bone ramp, then turn left to find another chest (AP Boost). Continue
along the path and, at the fork, go right. You'll encounter some Aerial
Knocker Heartless (the Rapid Blow Reaction Command easily finishes the battle).
After that battle, find the elephant skull ahead on the ledge; to your left,
you'll find another chest (Mythril Shard). Now, pass the skull ledge and go
straight to yet another chest (Ether). Next, turn around and face the skull.
Go up the ramp and, to the left of the skull, you'll find another chest, in
which you'll find a Mythril Stone. Finally, exit the area to the east, to the
Savannah.

Here, you'll find no treasure, only Heartless. Fight some of them if you wish,
but you'll eventually have to go north to Pride Rock, seen as that huge rocky
outcropping in the distance.

At Pride Rock, Sora is told that he can't really help out, seeing as he can't
be the next king. If you return to the beginning of the area, you'll find a
small cave, in which you'll find a Save Point. Next, go below Pride Rock to
find a chest (Mythril Stone). Go further left of that to find a (Mega-Ether).
In front of Pride Rock, on the ground, in a chest, is the Pride Rock Map.
Seeing as you can't help, you may as well try to leave the area, which brings
you in contact with some the hyenas from earlier. Pete -- who hasn't gotten
used to four legs, obviously -- also shows his face.

After the quick scene, Nala will lead you back into the Savannah. Follow her
to the southeast. In the next area, in the following cutscene, Nala teaches
the Dash ability to Sora (and he was already; it lets him go at obscene speeds)
and then you'll be in the Wildebeest Valley. From the start, go straight to
a chest (Hi-Potion); then right around the rock for another (Mythril Stone);
then left along the wall to get another (Mythril Gem); then the one in the
distance (AP Boost); and, finally, the one left of the way to the ??? area,
which will reveal a Tent. Nothing else is here, continue on to the next area,
the Wastelands.

The Wastelands area is very linear with a fair amount of Heartless to fight, as
well as some chests. From start to finish, you'll find a Mythril Shard, then a
Hi-Potion, and, finally, a Mythril Stone. Continue on to the Jungle.

This area is also small and fairly linear, with some chests and more Heartless.
In front of you, upon entering, you'll find a chest containing a Hi-Potion. Go
along either path in the fork; at the end of it, you'll find a chest (Serenity
Stone). Continue towards the next area -- be sure to open the last chest for
the Jungle, a Mythril Stone -- the Oasis. There, you'll have a reunion with an
old friend (and Summon): Simba.

After the scene, before going to help Simba, let's raid the Oasis. In the area,
you'll find the last three chests: an AP Boost, an Oasis Map, and some Torn
Pages. You can also lighten your wallet (or whatever) at the Moogle Shop; a
Dreamcloud (for Goofy) and Lord's Broom (for Donald) are possibly better
weapons for Donald and Goofy. You can also use the Save Point.

Anywho, when you go out to help Simba, you'll find out that Nala -- an old
friend of Simba's -- was out there, too. After the scene, go over to Simba to
cheer him up. After THAT cutscene, you'll have Simba in your party, as well be
given the Circle of Life Keyblade. Now, let's return to Pride Rock.

Along the way, you should expect to run into some new Heartless: Shaman. They
can turn into a mask form, which makes them temporarily invincible. An all-out
offensive or the Dispel Reaction Command both work well.

Once you get to the Savannah, you'll automatically get to Pride Rock.

After some scenes (thinking of the movie yet?), Simba will chase Scar up to the
summit while Timon and Pumbaa "voluntarily distract" the hyenas in the cave. I
think you can go to the Stone Hollow to use the Save Point; return to the Den
when you're ready to fight.

============================
BOSS: Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed
============================

This is a fairly basic battle, actually. You'll have to protect Pumbaa's "HP"
while you KO the hyenas; too much damage and you'll lose. It helps to try to KO
one at a time, so lock-on to one and let the Keyblade fly! Additionally, it may
help to call to Pumbaa while the hyenas circle him: it may stun the hyenas.
You'll win when all three hyenas are KO'ed.

For winning, Sora's max HP increases by five; Donald's max HP increases by 4;
and Goofy learns Lucky Lucky.


After the battle, the hyenas flee, but Simba is still fighting Scar on the
summit! Go check on him!! (You can go and save, if wanted. And jump off Pride
Rock. And stuff.)

==========
BOSS: Scar
==========

It's a good thing to have Simba in your party: the Wildcat Limit can easily do
damage faster than basic attacks and magic.

From the start, you'll notice the Scar is going obscenely fast. To hit him,
you'll have to properly time your attacks or Scar will be able to hit back.
From time to time, Scar will tackle you and roll around. The Counter Reaction
Command will pop up; use it to avoid damage.

Scar also has a few elemental attacks. One is lightning-based: he'll have orbs
of lightning circling around him while he stalks towards you, dashing fast at
the last second with some lightning following him. The best thing to do here
is either get out of the way beforehand or use the Wildcat Limit.

He also has a fire-based attack. For this one, he'll jump acrund somewhat fast
and leave flaming pillars behind him as he goes. You can catch mid-jump and
stop him by hitting him; otherwise, stay around.

After about half of his HP is gone, Scar will radiate dark energy and begin to
float a bit off of the ground. His speed will drastrically increase and he will
proceed to chase you without relent. It will be tough to attack him at this
point; I recommend just Dashing away. After the attack is over, he'll leave
himself open for a few seconds -- let 'im have it!!

As a reward for winning, Sora's max MP increases by 10; Donald learns Fire
Boost; Goofy's max HP increaes by 5; and Simba's max HP increases by 30.


After the battle, Scar will fall over, dead (!!), and Simba will reclaim the
Pride Lands. Soon after, Sora will unlock the next world and have his Fire
magic upgraded a level to Fira.

Okay, now there are several things you can do. You can do the Cerberus Cup that
just opened at the Coliseum (Section XVIII), use this world's Torn Pages to do
something in the 100 Acre Wood (Section XXIX), finish Atlantica (Section XVI),
or go to Twilight Town (Section XX).

As before, there is nothing plot-related here for the moment. We are here for
the Cerberus Cup. Talk to Panic (the skinny blue guy) to select it.

This Cup paradoxically removes your partners while letting you use the Drive
Gauge. Additionally, the Drive Gauge can recharge itself in a mere few hits, so
you'll probably be using a Form almost the entire time (God forbid you use Anti
Form).

you well. I'd prefer to use Wisdom Form, so you'll be able to use a Form from
the next battle's beginning.


O==========================O------------------------------------------------O
|  CERBERUS CUP: MATCH #9  |  ENEMIES: Emerald Blues (x4), Fat Bandit (x1)  |
O==========================O------------------------------------------------O

This battle also is fought in a dark area. Seeing as you probably aren't going
to see the Fat Bandit easily, I'd seriously consider using Wisdom Form.


O===========================O---------------------O
|  CERBERUS CUP: MATCH #10  |  ENEMIES: Cerberus  |
O===========================O---------------------O

This battle is virtually the same as the last one, except that Auron is not
with you and the room is darkened. Freely use Valor Form; it'll help greatly.


For winning the Cerberus Cup, you'll get the Rising Dragon -- a weapon for
Donald -- and the Protect Belt.

Now, you can either go to Atlantica (Section XVI), do the 100 Acre Wood thing
(Section XIX), or go to Twilight Town (Section XX).

This time, assuming this is the SECOND time you came, you'll find another area
popped up: Rabbit's House. Go there and you'll see Pooh floating in and down on
a balloon, landing on Eeyore's house (got insurance?). After thinking for a
bit, Sora and Piglet decide that feeding Pooh some honey may jog his memory.

Before deciding to do so, after the cutscene, look to the right. You'll find
two chests, in which you'll find an AP Boost and a Mythril Crystal. Go to the
left while facing the door to Rabbit's House to find a chest behind the
clothesline -- in it is the Draw Ring. Once ready, approach Eeyore. Pooh then
proceeds to eat lots, if not all, of Rabbit's Honey.

After the scene, you'll start a very cool minigame. It is, in essence, a race
to the finish line, with obstacles and honey in the way. The honey may wait
until next time you play, although you may as well get in some practice. By
hitting an obstacle, Pooh will fall off and lose 1 of his 10 HP (lose all ten
and you'll lose). To help you, pick up Gopher; he offers one-time protection.
To move, use the Analog Stick. Hold Square to move left/right faster. Press
Triangle to pick up Pooh or Gopher. Fairly simple. Just make it to the end and
you'll win.


In the scene after the minigame, Pooh will get stuck in the hole to Rabbit's
House, which he is soon tugged out of. The fall jogged his memory -- partially.
It seems that he still doesn't remember Sora.

Okay, from here, you can either do the Atlantica thing (Section XVI), the
Cerberus Cup at Olympus Coliseum (Section XVIII), or Twilight Town
(Section XIX).

When you land at Twilight Town, Vivi will run past, yelling thay something's
happened to Seifer. Obviously, you might wanna check it out -- head to the
Sandlot. There, you'll find Seifer surrounded by Nobodies. Seeing as Sora has
the only Keyblade in sight, you'll do the fighting.

The battle begins pretty simply with some Dusks, which are among the weaker
Nobodies, if you remember. Soon after, though, a Berserker appears. These are
somewhat tough and can easily block many attacks from the front; you'll have to
hit them from behind. They have a chopping-esque attack, too, which can be
pretty painful. When one drops it weapon, go near it and use the Reaction
Command Berserk, then Eclipse and Magna Storm to do some serious damage. After
finishing that one, you'll fight three. It is very recommended to use a Drive
Form or the Berserk-Eclipse-Magna Storm commands.

After the battle, Seifer will shove his Struggle Trophy into Goofy's hands.
Now, you'll go to the Station Plaza. There, you'll get the Oathkeeper Keyblade.
Now, to Hollow Bastion (not for the 100 Acre Wood).

Upon landing, head to Cloud (in his Advent Children clothing). After the scene,
let's go to Merlin's House. Along the way, you'll fight the Bookmasters, who
place their forte in magic -- theirs is strong and yours won't hurt it. An
all-out defense is preferred. When done, go to Merlin's House.

After the scene there, you'll now being going to the computer room in the
castle. Begin by going to the Bailey, where you'll meet slightly altered
versions of Yuna, Rikku, and Paine (from Final Fantasy X-2). After that scene,
continue forward. Along the way, you'll find the Armored Knight, which is a
slightly-better Soldier. They like to attack in numbers (as you'll see in a
few hours), but that matters little when you factor in the Rising Sun Reaction
Command they let you use. You'll also encounter the Morning Star (quite similar
to its 358/2 Days form, FYI). They pack a lot of HP and Defense. If you have
Upper Slash equipped, it'll help greatly. They like to bounce around when low
on HP; use the Meteor Strike Reaction Command then.

From the Bailey, head south to the Restoration Site. There, you'll fight some
of the new enemies. It is quite uneventful. Exit on the other side to the
Postern.

In the Postern area, use the Save Point and open the chests. Near where you
entered from, on a pipe, you'll find a chest (Mythril Gem). On the other side
of this pipe is another cehst (Castle Perimeter Map). Drop off deom here onto
the walkway and you'll find another chest (AP Boost). Go through the doorway
into the maze-like Corridors.

Here, you'll find many Heartless and quite a few chests. One new Heartless,
the Surveillance Bot, can be found here. They pose little threat. The Reaction
Commands you can use (Snag -> Sparkle Ray) can damage or kill other nearby
enemies easily.

Anyhow, from the start, go forward, right at the corner, then left at the
fork, and forward to a chest (Hi-Potion). Go right to the fork, go left, and
you'll find another chest in some rubble (Mythril Stone). Continue along the
path, ignoring the hall to the left, to find a Mythril Crystal in a chest.
Turn around and along the ignored hall from earlier to go to a large room.
Go across to the west side and go along the corridor and you'll find an
AP Boost. Return to the large room and go into the southern hallway. Continue
along it and you'll find a door; go through it.

After the scene, grab the Skill Recipe out of the chest that is near Leon.
After that, speak to him. You'll find the secret passage to the computer. It's
obvious Sora knows little about computers (explemified by his two mishaps with
the Gummi Ship). Luckily, Sora soon stops, only to have his efforts of calming
himself vanquished by Stitch. In essence, Sora and the team are digitized and
transported to a strange world within a world, or something. You'll see in a
second.

After entering this world, the team is promptly arrested and sent to a jail
cell. Tron is to be their cellmate. Their first order of business: bust out.
It is as simple as hitting the door several times, grabbing some orbs, and
using the Freeze Reaction Command, which opens the door. Before leaving the
cell area, use the Save Point and Moogle Shop, then, as you leave the area,
grab the Mythril Crystal and Pit Cell Area Map from the two chests. Use the
glowing platform as a method of transportation to get to the Canyon.

There, open the chest near Goofy to get a Drive Recovery. Go on further up the
ramp to find a Mythril Stone, and later, a Mega-Potion inside the chests. After
getting to the top of the ramp, go left to find another chest, in which you'll
find a Mythril Gem. Now, drop down into the central area and exmaine the pillar
thing in the middle.

For this minigame or whatever, there will be a ring of boxes around you. You
need the red box -- when you see it, control the camera to keep an eye on it,
because it'll turn blue like the other ones. Whack it a few times to win. If
you lose it, you can hit the blue blocks to charge up the Cluster gauge and
Freeze the boxes.

After that, return to the Pit Cell, then use the console and you'll return to
Hollow Bastion, inside the computer room.

After returning from the world of the computer, Tifa will come in and "search"
around some more, revealing some kind of diagram behind a painting. Examine it
to deal with a long and teasing scene, during which you'll be given the Master
Form, which will be your best for QUITE a while -- possibly even the whole
game if you're so unlucky.

Anywho, return to the computer room. On the way, open the chest to recieve the
Ukulele Charm, which allows you to summon Stitch. Examine the computer and
access the Pit Cell.

Upon re-entering the Pit Cell, the team will be automatically transported to
the Game Gird. There, you'll be forced to play Light Cycle.

In Light Cycle, you are put onto a motorcycle of sorts and you are dodging
walls and killing Heartless. You'll use the Left Analog Stick to move left
and right, L1/R1 to turn around corners and at intersections when the arrows
appear, X to attack and break and enemy's charge (usually kill, too), Square
to Charge and break an enemy's guard, and Circle to protect yourself. When it
comes to blue/yellow enemies, Attack is best; as for green/grey ones, I usually
Charge.

In the first round, simply kill a few enemies and you'll continue onward.
Remember to note that being hit or hitting a wall empties some of Sora's HP.
In the second round, an exit is opened, so it is mostly an endurance round. Do
not worry about which way to turn, just choose. Obviously, you'll have to
defeat some Heartless or you'll risk losing. Be careful in both rounds -- you
cannot heal in Light Cycle.

After escaping, you are transported back to the Pit Cell, which is where you
find Tron again. After the scene, use the Save Point and Moogle Shop to your
heart's content, then exit the Pit Cell and go to the Canyon.

In the Canyon, you'll some new enemies called Strafers. They are weak and worth
little mention. When you're ready, exit to the northeast into the Dataspace.

There, go to the large monitor on the other side of the room and use the
Reaction Command. Tron will then input the password, but you'll have to fight
some Heartless soon afterwards. You'll have two minutes to Freeze each of the
monitors. To do so, fill up the Cluster gauge three times (once per monitor)
by defeating some of the innumerable enemies, then going near the monitor. I
would recommend waiting on the final freeze until the last thirty seconds to
leech a lot of EXP. out of the battle.

For succeeding, Sora's max HP will increase by five; Donald will learn Thunder
Boost; Goofy's max HP will increase by five; and Tron's max HP will increase by
15. Tron will also get full use of his abilities.

After the battle and scene, return to the Canyon. Move forward to the lift and
get on it; i'll take you to the I/O Tower. There, grab the two nearby chests
(Tent, AP Boost) and go right. In the large circular room, you'll fight the
aptly-named Devastator, a new variety of Heartless. These Heartless have a
good amount of HP and Strength. When its limbs glow, get away, as it will soon
shoot lasers. Don't be afraid to heal against these enemies. After the battle,
go through the doorway.

There, in the Communications Room, open the two chests (I/O Tower Map, Gaia
Belt). Use the Save Point. For the following battle, I highly recommend on
using Draw and the Draw Ring, if possible. Return to the previous room to
initiate the boss.

=====================
BOSS: Hostile Program
=====================

This boss (wisely) decides to try on the opposite side of the circular area
from you. However, you can easily catch up to it most of the time, especially
if you have Quick Run from leveling up Wisdom Form. However, it will slide
away fast when it hits you. It isn't too good to stay away, either: it can
shoot fairly powerful lasers.

Anywho, to start, run up to it (preferably in Valor or Master Forms) and start
whacking it. This will drop some cluster orbs (see that gauge? That's why I
told you to equip Draw!!). Even when you get knocked back, get right back into
the fray and continue this until the gauge is filled. When this happens, use
the Freeze Reaction Command, and then wail on it (in Valor or Master Form if
you aren't already in it).

As it loses HP, you'll notice that it'll start dash around the edge of the
arena sometimes. Nothing worth mentioning at that point, it is just trying to
evade you. As for when it gets very low on HP, it'll sweep the area with many
lasers. Tron's Limit is a good idea for this stage, as it'll make Sora and the
party temporarily invincible, do some major damage over a period of time, and
drop more cluster orbs.

For winning this battle, Sora learns Horizontal Slash and his Drive Gauge's
max is upped by one; Donald's max HP is upped by four; Goofy learns Jackpot;
and Tron's max HP is upped fifteen.


After the battle, you should receive the Photon Debugger Keyblade (or sometime
very soon). You are now to leave the Space Paranoids by the monitor, so do so.

After exiting the Space Paranoids, things are finally explained, and then an
explosion rocks the castle. Return to the Corridors and you'll fight both
Heartless and Nobodies in battle AT THE SAME TIME. The Dancers are really worth
mentioning, although the Crimson Jazz can easily do some damage to you; if you
have Retaliating Slash, it may help out some. They also can leaving exploding
red spheres, some of which may follow you. If you're having trouble, use Valor
Form (easy leveling).

After the battle, you'll be at the Postern. Use the Save Point and begin to
head into town, first by going to the Restoration Site. There, you'll fight
some Creepers and Dancers. Nothing worth mentioning. After THAT battle, you'll
be in the Bailey (no walking today, eh?). When you're ready, apporach the
path to the castle in the distance, and, after the quick scene.....

===========
BOSS: Demyx
===========

Expect several Game Overs here, especially if you're at a low level, expect to
use a Drive Form, or are just under-experienced.

The fight begins (like Olympus) with some water forms. You'll have to kill
fifty forms in forty seconds (1.25 per second). Like in Olympus, to avoid the
Game Over from taking too much time, use Wild Dance as much as possible. If
you're somewhat lucky, you'll make it. If you defeated all fifty in forty
seconds...

Demyx will begin a personal offensive, sort of. He likes to dart around a lot,
leaving some geysers. He can follow this with a defensive circle of geyseys
around himself. He may also control some fast water bubbles; you'll know he's
about to make some when he starts to dance. He can, unluckily, say "Dance,
water, dance!" which causes the area to slightly darken and give you a mere
ten seconds to kill ten water forms. Rapidly slam X and Triangle; if you're
very lucky, you make it. Also, AND THIS IS A COMPLETELY THEORETICAL IDEA, try
using Donald's Fantasia, but select to do the last bit of it.

By about the time Demyx loses half of his HP, he'll hit you with his sitar.
It is tough to break out of his combos without Retaliating Slash. He can also
summon a wall of geysers in front of him about every second. He even has some
homing geysers. He may say "Ain't it a blast?" and dance at you. Use Show
Stealer when it appears to damage him; otherwise, the same happens to YOU.

Now, for a strategy... Demyx can easily be defeated with combos. If you can
do enough of a ground combo to knock him in the air, then do an aerial combo,
you'll do some decent damage. If you cannot do this, then simply wail on him
when you can, and heal when you can't. Drive Forms are a very bad idea for a
few reasons. Firstly, and this has been proven, you may transform into that
dark form (Anti-Form), which can happen more often here (I think it was 5X more
often). Also, whenever Demyx does one of those challenges with the water forms,
Drive Forms tend to add a lot of flair and glamor to his attacks, making it
much longer. Good luck.

For winning, Sora gets an armor slot and Blizzard upgrade; Donald learns
Blizzard Boost; and Goofy's max HP increases by five.


After the battle and scene, you'll do even more fighting. It is against some
Heartless, and you'll have some of the Final Fantasy characters, like Tifa,
Yuffie, and Cloud, to help you out. There is a series of battles, and only one
character helps in each battle. If you wait around lazily, you'll even see
their limit breaks. After the last battle (helped by Cloud), you'll head into
the next and get a Cure upgrade and Goofy returns to your party. (Remember to
FULLY re-equip him). Loot of the four chests (Elixir, AP Boost, The Great Maw
Map, and Torn Pages) nearby for some treasures, use the Save Point, then go
into the next area...

... and feel satisfaction. After the cutscene, Sora -- and Sora alone -- will
have to fight no less than 1,000 Heartless (now come images into your head of
Dustfliers, Eliminators, and Darksides). No, it is not any of them. Instead, it
is just a bunch of Armored Knights and Surveillance Robots. Simply repeatedly
use their Reaction Commands and you'll eliminate them in just a couple of
minutes.

For beating the crap out of a lot of Heartless, Sora will learn Guard Break.

After the battle, there will be some scenes. During them, you'll find an Ice
Cream, a Picture, and Secret Ansem's Report #1.

Back on the world map, I demand you return to Hollow Bastion. There, return
to the Restoration Site and open the chests in the new area (AP Boost, Moon
Recipe), then go to the Postern. Talk to Yuna and you'll eventually be given
a chest, in which you'll find the Gull Wing Keyblade. This is a big aid in
leveling up fast.

Now, seeing as your here, let's put those Torn Pages from earlier back into
the book.

If you don't want to, we're basically going to cover each world once again.
For the most part, I'll cover like I did earlier. Sections XXVII through XXXIX
will cover the non-linear part of re-covering.

After slapping in the third set of Torn Pages, Kanga and Roo's House will be
popped up. Go there. You'll also find Tigger there, too. Kanga will give you
some medicine that she things will make Pooh better, and then Tigger snatches
it. Before doing something, open the nearby chests (AP Boost, Magic Boost,
Orichalcum). When ready, talk to Tigger.

This starts the next minigame, Balloon Bounce. You'll simply jump up into the
air and get onto balloons, and higher and higher by using Reaction Commands.
You merely have to pop ten balloons in a single minute to finish this.

After this, you now have to redo the worlds. I'll cover in as close an order as
I can like I did in the earlier sections. Sections XXVII through XXXIX will
cover the recovering.

This time, when you land, you'll arrive at the burned village. There, you'll
find that Mulan has been chasing a hooded figure. Seeing as you see few hooded
ANYTHING in the Land of Dragons, it may just be Organization XIII. Follow this
person up the Ridge and to the Summit, where you'll encounter him.

That sword looks familiar...

====================
BOSS: Mysterious Man
====================

This battle is pretty easy, actually. If my memory serves correctly -- and it
usually does -- it is just Sora versus the hooded man and lots of Rapid
Thrusters. If you want, you can hack away at them for some extra EXP. When/If
you're done with that, just hack away at the man -- nothing special he can do.
The battle will end when he has about one HP bar left.


After the battle, a huge dragon-like Heartless bursts out of the mountain and
begins to fly to the Imperial City. Obviously, you'll need to go after it. Exit
the Summit, go to the Ridge and the Village, go along the path to the
Checkpoint, and exit to the east. Along the way, you'll encounter the
Neoshadow, which are more powerful Shadows, in essence, and you can use
Reaction Commands on them.

When you arrive at the Imperial Square, you'll find everything is fine -- the
real trouble is in the palace, for the moment. As you go in, you'll find some
Heartless, Bolt Towers and an Assault Rider, specificly; nothing worth mention.
After defeating them, enter the palace. In the Antechamber, approach the
black-hooded figure. Sora will reveal his suspicions that this is Riku,
although he find that it is Xigbar, Organization XIII's Number II, under the
hood. He'll run away, leaving you to fight some Sniper Nobodies.

These Heartless aren't worth much mention. They primarily will use their laser
gun to damage you, and they can warp around. What you can do is, when a laser
hovers near you, is use the Reaction Command Warp Snipe to warp and hit the
laser repeatedly.

After the battle, in the Throne Room, you find most everything in an orderly
condition. There are a lot of chests in here; eight, to be precise. The hardest
of them to find are behind the throne (two chests) and those in the shadows,
directly in front of the larger chests, on the rear wall. All together, you'll
find two AP Boosts, a Mythril Crystal, a Orichalcum, a Palace Map, the Queen
Recipe, some Torn Pages, and an Ogre Shield. Use the Save Point and, when
ready, exit the Palace to the Gates to fight that dragon.

=================
BOSS: Storm Rider
=================

As in the scene, you'll begin fighting on the Heartless's back. Eventually, the
Reaction Command Hang On will appear. It is recommended to use to stay on and
attack safely; otherwise, you'll have to figure out how to get back on.

While safely on the back, it is a good idea to hit the cone-like objects on the
shoulders. Once these are defeated, the boss will be stunned, hit the ground,
and leave itself open for a while.

If you fall off, look for the whirlwinds on the ground. Approach one and use
the Reaction Commands Ride the Wind and Soar to get into the air. You can move
around while inside the whirlwind, so use that to your advantage.

While it fights on the ground, the Storm Rider can use a weak, but
unpredictable, Thunder attack. It can also send many, many explosives flying
from its underside. It may also use some lasers after landing on the opposite
side of the area.

Another tough move to avoid is when it settles itself on the bridge going to
the Palace. Two electrical walls will appear and move closer together. They
won't meet, but they will force you in front of the Storm Rider, who'll shoot
a huge beam of electrictiy. To stay safe, stand by its foot.

A good aid for you will be the Slide and Vertigo Toss Reaction Commands, which
can be used when the cerature flies low to the ground towards you. This will
ground and stun the Heartless temporarily.

Once the boss is stunned, the general idea is simple: use Valor Form, unless
Master Form is at a higher level. It is also a good idea to use a Drive while
on the Storm Rider's back. A good alternative is some Limits.

For winning, Sora gets a Thunder upgrade; Donald's max HP increases by four;
Goofy learns Tornado Fusion; and Mulan's max HP is upped by 25.


After the battle, there are a few scenes and you are sent to the World Map.
Seeing as you got some Torn Pages, we'll go to the 100 Acre Wood.

After slapping in the fourth set of Torn Pages, the new area that pops up will
be the Spooky Cave. Go there. There, you'll find that Pooh went into the cave
and got lost somewhere along the way. So, we have to find him.

Here's a map, credits to ElectroSpecter.

                                              '.         .'  '_.'       | |
                                                |   .---'____          START

(POOH) The end of maze, where Pooh is.           \_____.-.__.'


Anyway, the minigame goes like this. By using the map above, or your
navigational senses, you'll have to find Pooh (or the chests, THEN Pooh).
However, firstly, there is the Courage Gauge in the corner. As you go forward,
it will empty. When it is emptied, the party panicks and you'll have to use a
Reaction Command to calm them. If there is a hazard, like bees or falling
rocks, around, the gauge will empty faster. If you the ice twinkle or dust
fall from the ceiling, use a Reaction Command to stop everyone. In the case of
bees, smack them with the Keyblade. Once you reach Pooh, a cutscene should
ensue.

After it, you'll get the Sweet Memories Keyblade -- Sora's Lucky Lucky weapon
and the one that produces no stat gain -- and the Spooky Cave Map.

 [There are no items, enemies, etc., to be found in this world at this time.]

After finishing the second musical and returning here with a Drive Gauge at or
above level five, you can talk to Sebastian to do the third.

In this one, you'll find a new pink gauge -- it is triggered with the Square
button. It also has the timing thing, like the X and Triangle gauges, but your
performance depends on the character in the middle. If it is Ariel, DO press
Square. If it is Sebastian, do NOT press Sqaure. Also remember that the gauge
will indeed often change. To finish the musical, you'll need to get enough of
the gauges right to get Ariel in a good mood by the end, shown by the gauge.
Get it as high as possible by the end.

After this, you'll find Eric's pendant, wedged between some rocks. You'll need
to return with Magnera (and just Magnet could pull a statue from a shipwreck?).

    ~~~~~ To continue this world, come back with Magnera or Magnega. ~~~~~

After landing in the Castle, the team finds Beast in some dress clothes, pacing
the Entrance Hall. After offering the team very little information about what
is going on, he and Belle enter into the Ballroom. Donald, being his
mischievious little self, follows them into the Ballroom. There, you'll
encounter an Organization member, after which you'll fight some Nobodies.

The Dragoons are more difficult than most basic enemies you've fought. They
like to teleport around like Snipers. However, they will directly attack you.
By using the Learn Reaction Command triggered around this time, you can turn
the Attack command into the Jump command, which will home in on the nearest
enemy and deal very decent damage. You can even stack up on Jumps. The
downward thrust these Nobodies use will not just attack you directly, but also
cause a shockwave, so beware of that. A Limit, like Fantasia, is best if you
have trouble.

After the battle, Cogsworth will tell you that he knows what's up. Speaking
with him reveals that he returned to his room (in the West Wing). Simply go
to the Entrance Hall, then the West Hall, then up the stairs to the West Wing,
then to the end of the hall. There, Beast will ask you to leave the castle...
Belle, too. Sora has other plans, though. Talk to the Beast to persuade him
to come with you. After the resulting scene, you'll get the Castle Walls Map
and the Rumbling Rose Keyblade.

Now, return to the Entrance Hall. There, you'll find Xaldin (Organization
XIII's Number III) waiting with Beast's Rose and proceeds to reveal a bit of
what he plans to do. After this, you'll fight more Dragoons and Dusks; as
before, a Limit is optimal for trouble. After the battle, go to the Courtyard.
Beast will bust open the doors to another to area to find Belle kidnapped, who
easily escapes with the rose. After that, you'll fight Xaldin.

============
BOSS: Xaldin
============

You'll notice that Xaldin likes lances: he wields six, and likes to use them
all. This, when combined with his techniques, can easily let you stack Jumps.

As for his attacks, he can zap you with electricty when he's in the air. He
can also create slow-moving balls of electricity. The former is best dealt with
by dodging; the latter by Guarding.

As Xaldin loses HP, he'll get more aggressive. For example, Xaldin will at one
point ride his lances like a dragon and shoot a huge beam of energy (similar
looking to Aeroblast if you've played Pokemon) across the whole bridge. It is
very powerful and is best avoided by a Jump.

One strategy is to stack nine Jumps and, when Xaldin has about half his HP, use
them all and then Beast's Limit. If you can't, you can always just wail on him.
Beyond the dragon thing, he won't get much more. Valor will accelerate how fast
this goes, although it is quite likely you'll use Anti-Form, so beware.

For winning, Sora gets a Reflect upgrade and his max HP upped by five; Donald
learns Auto Healing; Goofy's max HP is upped by five; and Beast has his max HP
increases by 25.


After the battle, you'll receive Secret Ansem's Report #4. After the scene, you
will be ejected to the World Map. From here, you can go to Port Royal (Section
XXXI) or Olympus Coliseum (Section XXXII). I'll cover Port Royal, due to the
lower battle level.

After landing, the team will hear something down at the Harbor and proceed to
investigate; head down the steps.

They find Jack there, fighting off a trio of Undead Pirates, despite that we
should have eliminated the curse the last time we were here. After defeating
them (remember, they are only able to be damaged in the moonlight), Jack claims
to have no hand in the dispersion of the Aztec gold. Elizabeth then informs you
that Will went to Isle de Muerta to check on the gold himself. Head onto the
dock and to the Black Pearl. Talk to Jack to set sail for Isle de Muerta.

As before, on the way there, you'll fight some Undead Pirates and Lance
Soldiers; it is worth little mention, seeing as you've fought them before.
After the battle, as you continue sailing, you'll find the Interceptor with an
unconscious will aboard it. After he wakes up, he'll tell that the gold is gone
and that it is quite likely that Organization XIII had a hand in it. Jack isn't
very keen on encountering any more monsters and refuses to sail to Isle de
Muerta. After the scene, use the Save Point and go above deck. There, you'll
encounter another scene, where you're introduced to another Organization XII
member, Luxord, and his pile of gold. Wait a minute... After the scene, you'll
fight the Grim Reaper.

=================
BOSS: Grim Reaper
=================

This enemy is fairly easy. A lot of magic, some Limits, a Drive Form, or just
plain flat-out wailing on it will do the trick. As for the attacks, they aren't
too strong and are easily dealt with by using Guards.

For winning, Sora will get Summon Boost; Donald's max HP is upped by four;
Goofy learns Draw; and Jack's max HP is increased by ten.


After the battle, Luxord restarts the Undead curse of the gold. The Grim Reaper
will rise from the water below and blow you to the deck other the other,
shipwrecked ship. After the scene, open the chest near the Save Point to get
the final Summon of the game, Peter Pan, from the Feather Charm. Also be sure
to use the Save Point, then go to the next area.

There, fight some enemies along the linear path. Along the way, open the three
chests (High Drive Recovery, Mythril Crystal, King Recipe).

In the next area, Seadrift Keep, you'll find a Gambler (Nobody) that has one of
the four Medallions. You can either use a Reaction Command to win (the battle,
as well as some decent Munny) or just wail on it. The Gambler can't really hurt
you, so your method is your choice.

After the battle, you'll get the Cursed Medallion. According to Jack's keen
eye, you have three more to go. You'll also get the Ship Graveyard Map.

As for the other three Medallions, their locations are random. They'll appear
in the hands of a Gambler randomly when you enter an area; you'll also get a
limited time to defeat it. So, I can't give much help here.

Seeing as you're sailing around, return to the Ship Graveyard's Seadrift Keep.
There, you'll find three chests in the area. In them, you'll find an AP Boost,
an Orichalcum, and Donald's Meteor Staff.

After snatching back all four Medallions, you'll return to the ship
automatically. Head to town. As you go, it is recommended Donald be in your
party.

=================
BOSS: Grim Reaper
=================

For this battle, you'll first begin by trying to put all of the Medallion back
into the chest. Until you do, you won't be able to damage the Grim Reaper. The
Grim Reaper can steal Medallions, and you can only grab them by hitting it with
magic (good idea to have Donald!). When the Medallions fall, simply touch them
to get them.

Once the Grim Reaper's Medallion count is zero (look at the counters at the top
of the screen), go over to the chest and use the Reaction Command to fill it
up. If some are still missing, look around or hit the Grim Reaper with some
magic.

Once the chest is filled, you can damage the Grim Reaper. If you want to hurry
up, Valor Form is recommended.

After some time, the boss will suck some Medallions out of the chest. While it
is doing this, run over to it and use the Hinder Reaction Command, then Loot
Launch to make the boss drop a lot of gold. After that, you'll have to refill
the chest.

There are a few things to remember. Firstly, you can physically attack the
Grim Reaper for some MP orbs. Secondly, don't use Limits, as they waste
valuable MP.

For winning, Sora gets a Magnet upgrade; Donald learns Flare Force; Goofy's max
HP is upped by five; and Jack's max HP is upped by 15.


After the scene that occurs after the battle, you'll get Secret Ansem's Report
#6.

From here, you can do some more of Atlantica (Section XXXIV), the Olympus
Coliseum Titan Cup (if you've finished Olympus) (Section XXXIII), or finish
Olympus (Section XXXII).

It seems that Olympus Coliseum (and Herc) are still in pretty rough shape.
Hades has set up a special cup for this time around.

When you're ready, talk to the fat reddish guy beside the blue skinny one.

In this, there are no restrictions, not even for items and EXP. gains. There
are no special rules and Herc will help you out. Once Auron shows up, follow
him into the Cave of the Dead. After that scene, speak with him. After THAT,
head to Hades' Chamber. On the way there, you find Crescendos. They are weak,
but can heal their allies (or you, with the right Reaction Command).

After nabbing Auron's Statue (and experiencing some FFX dialogue), some Dusks
will appear and attack. As usual, they are worth little mention.

After the battle, you'll reappear at the Underworld Entrance. Enter the cup.
There, you'll fight Hades.

===========
BOSS: Hades
===========

For the first bit of the fight, you can't damage Hades (his domain, remember?).

After Herc appears, THEN you do some damage. From the start, Herc will make two
glowing orbs. Hit one into Hades to weaken him and damage him. Valor Form is a
good idea to speed it up. He'll eventually return to usual form, though, as
well the usual invincibility.

He has a few basic attacks. The one's you want to look out for are the column
of fire (he'll say "That's it!" and make a ring of fire where the pillar will
rise) and the giant globe of fire that rains down tiny fireballs (ignore it;
it is mainly used to distract you).

If you want to damage Hades, wait for Herc to summon some more Aura Spheres and
hit them. Also, you can use Aura Shield to shield yourself when near Herc.

For winning, Sora learns Counterguard and his MP is upped by 10; Donald gets an
accessory slot; Goofy's max HP is upped by 5; and Auron's max HP is upped by
fifteen.


After the battle and scene, you'll get the Guardian Soul Keyblade and unlock
the Titan Cup.

From here, you can do Port Royal (Section XXXI) or the Titan Cup (Section
XXXIII).

After beating Olympus for the second time, the Titan Cup is unlocked. For this
one, you can use Summons, but you'll be alone. Sora also has a second HP amount
set at 500. They empty faster the harder Sora is hit, and don't refill. The
amount is for all ten battles; you lose if they empty.

O=======================O------------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #1  |  ENEMIES: Magnum Loader (x2), Dusk (x3)  |
O=======================O------------------------------------------O

Pretty basic fight. Don't worry about Summoning.


O=======================O---------------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #2  |  ENEMIES: Assassin (x4), Morning Star (x1)  |
O=======================O---------------------------------------------O

|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #3  |  ENEMIES: Strafer (x4), Berserker (x2)  |
O=======================O-----------------------------------------O

The Beserkers can make it tough. Try grabbing their weapon to use it against
them. If you cannot, a Summon may help you out.


O=======================O------------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #4  |  ENEMIES: Trick Ghost (x3), Sniper (x2)  |
O=======================O------------------------------------------O

Pretty basic fight. Don't worry about Summoning.


O=======================O----------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #5  |  ENEMIES: Dancer (x3), Neoshadow (x3)  |
O=======================O----------------------------------------O

Try to take out the Dancers first, as they'll grab your head and do a bunch of
damage. Don't worry about Summoning unless you get in bad trouble, though.


O=======================O----------------------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #6  |  ENEMIES: Bookmaster (x1), Air Pirate (x2),        |

O=======================O----------------------------------------------------O

As with Match #5, it'll help to grab the Berserker's weapon and beat them up
with it. After that, focus on the Dancers. A Summon isn't too bad.


O========================O---------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #10  |  ENEMIES: Hercules  |
O========================O---------------------O

Herc isn't too hard. You can easily dodge most of his attacks. However, he
will be invincible quite a bit, so back off from him until he is vulnerable
again. It isn't too good an idea to use a Summon because of the unpredictable
invincibility.


For winning, you'll the Genji Shield (for Goofy), and the Skillful Ring.

Now, from here, you can go to Port Royal (Section XXXI), Atlantica (if you beat
Port Royal) (Section XXXIV), or Agrabah (Section XXXV).

     [There are no items, enemies, etc., to be found here at this time.]

After giving Ariel the pendant, then talking to Sebastian, with some scenes in
between those events, you'll be ready for your fourth musical.

For this one, you'll find a new gauge. It is purple and, for it, you'll rapidly
press X. You'll also get some of the original X gauges, so be careful. As you
press X, you'll empty some of Ursula's HP. To win, have the gauge empty by the
end.

For winning, you'll get a Keyblade, the Mysterious Abyss.

         ~~~~~ To continue this world, come back with Thundaga. ~~~~~

From here, you can go to Olympus (Section XXXII), the tournament (Section
XXXIII), or Agrabah (Section XXXV).

When you land, you'll find Iago who will tell you the current location of the
escaped Jafar. It seems he is in the ruins outside of Agrabah. Go through the
Bazaar and exit to the Palace Walls. There, Genie will dissipate the sandstorm,
letting you into the ruins.

There, Sora will ride on the Magic Carpet and chase Jafar's shadow. Each time
you get to Jafar, he'll summon some Heartless and speed away. FYI, to control
the Carpet, use the left analog stick to move forward/left/right/back and the
right analog stick to move up/down.

After defeating the Heartless, you'll have to chase the shadow again. Look for
when it starts to cast a spell -- lock-on to it and attack it. After doing this
several times, a new part of the area is opened, where you'll find a large
tower. Approach the shadow and you'll fight some more Heartless.

After defeating the Heartless atop the tower, a strange object appears.
Examine it to find three switches around the area. You'll have to trigger each
with a magic spell.

Ignore the one closest to the tower door for now and head out into the larger
area -- this will give you a slight advantage later. Right near the entrance to
the Agrabah area, you'll find a switch. When its orbs line up, they are
yellow. Time the casting of the spell so it'll hit when the orbs are lined up;
for this set, use a Thunder spell.

Next, fly to the narrow pass near the tower, but, as you approach it, look left
to find a switch under a bridge. This functions like the previous one, except
the orbs line up blue, which means you'll use Blizzard.

Now, for the final switch, go under the broken bridge leading into the tower
to find this switch, whose orbs line up red, which means you'll use Fire.

After activating all three switches, a door on the tower will open and you'll
have a short time to get to it. If you activated the Fire switch last, you're
at that tower. Go through the open door (after grabbing some quick EXP.).

Inside the tower, find and open the two chests: the Ruins Map and the final
set of Torn Pages (assuming you've gotten each set thus far). Now, go up the
nearby staircase to find Jafar not here. Are we early? No... Iago admits that
Jafar used him so that the team wouldn't be in Agrabah to stop him when he
attacks! A switch will soon be triggered, causing you to escape from the ruins.
You'll ride on Carpet across treacherous terrain. I think the game will
continue onward, regardless of whether you defeat enemies. BTW, if you hit an
enemy, you'll find it easily dies AND you get the same amount of EXP. Enjoy the
ride!

When you return to Agrabah, interrogate the peddler, then go to the Palace.

===========
BOSS: Jafar
===========

Jafar, being huge (and red), will hurl buildings at you. Though their path is
predictable, BUILDINGS ARE HUGE AND HARD TO DODGE. He also has a deceptively
long range for his hands, as well.

To start from here, target the stomach where the red band is. Wail on it and,
when it is out of HP, Jafar will keel over in pain, stunned. Ascend to and wail
on the head.

A different idea: instead of going straight for the head, go for the hands!
If you deplete their HP (he has two), empty his stomach's HP and then use the
Roll Up and Spin Burst Reaction Commands for a longer stun.

After a while, you'll find yourself in a black void with lots of debris (hmm...
reminds me of my sister's room...). There, don't try to calculate where the
debris will be -- move randomly! Guards and regular Attacks will also work.

After that, the cycle repeats. Empty Jafar's head's HP to win.

For winning, Sora will get a Fire upgrade, giving you Firaga.


In the scenes following the battle, you'll get the Wishing Lamp Keyblade.

Okay, from here, you can go to the 100 Acre Wood (Section XXXVI) or Halloween
Town (Section XXXVII).

Once you arrive in the book and slap in the fifth and final Torn Pages, go to
the new popped-up area. When you get there, search around first for the Cosmic
Ring and the Style Recipe. After this, go up to the top of the hill and decide
to help Pooh.

In this minigame, the Hunny Pot, you'll want to throw the pot a long distance.
When the power gauge is close to full, press Triangle. Do it again to pop Pooh
out.

For succeeding, Pooh will remember you. After the scenes, you'll get a Cure
upgrade (to Curaga, I believe) and an Orichalcum+ (!!).

From here, you'll pretty much have to go to Halloween Town (Section XXXVII).

After landing in Halloween Town, you figure out that Christmas presents have
been gift-napped. On Jack's "request", you'll set out to find the culprit.
Before you can, however, a crash is heard upstairs, probably from the Wrapping
Room. You'll have to go through the Toy Factory to get to it.

=========================
BOSS: Lock, Shock, Barrel
=========================

This battle is fairly simple, I guess. The main idea is empty a kid's HP and
then, using a Reaction Command, knock a box onto a kid. You'll have to do this
when said kid has no HP. Also, a tired kid will not stay tired forever.

For the most part, you shouldn't have much trouble, although Limits are good to
speed this along.

For winning, Sora gets an item slot; Donald's max HP increases by four; Goofy
learns Auto Changer; and Jack's max HP increases by five.


After the battle, you are convinced that it wasn't Lock, Shock, and Barrel who
stole the presents. Sally will soon arrive, saying that Heartless with presents
are running rampant in Halloween Town. Along the way to the Town Square, you'll
find the Halloween Town counterpart of the Toy Soldier -- the Graveyard. Treat
it as you would a Toy Soldier. You'll find this Heartless in the Graveyard.

In the Town Square, you'll find Wight Knights playing with some presents. You
will fight them. Your main goal is to get the presents from the Wight Knights,
although you can let the battle wear on to find more enemies and EXP. Limits
are preferable when you get into trouble. You'll get a Present upon winning
the battle.

After the battle, Jack will get an idea, one that Sora nor Santa seem to tryst
too much. Nevertheless, you'll return to Santa's House to, with his permission,
wrap some presents as bait for the thief. Return to the wrapping room on the
second floor of the factory and talk to the elf to begin.

For this minigame, you'll fill up empty gift boxes. These will continually roll
out of the chutes in the room. You'll need to use the Left Analog Stick to aim
left/right, X to shoot, and Triangle to reload (you have a "clip" of 30
presents). You can simply aim randomly -- there are no penalties for wasting --
and reload as needed. There are some different boxes that hold different
numbers of presents: the bigger the box, the more presents. If Lock, Shock, and
Barrel show up, hit them with presents to stop them for a bit.

After bagging the 100 Decoy Presents, Santa will help pick out a spot to leave
the bait. Talk to him to begin some scenes and the boss!

====================
BOSS: The Experiment
====================

The Experiment, when joined together, has some basic attacks: lasers, lunges,
shockwaves, and whirlwinds. These help to hit you while physically attacking,
so a hack-and-slasher (ie. me) will be hit a bit. Magic does little better in
terms of your protection, although it'll do less overall.

Remember how I said it was joined together? Well, a combo finisher may cause
the Experiment to break into segments: the torso (which will fly and spin; use
the Kickspring Reaction Command to keep it away), the head, and a few others.
The head can shoot some lasers. A neat idea is to use Kickspring to hit other
body parts or into the lasers.

After a while, it'll rejoin with a skull for a head -- it'll now only attack
physically, and with the rare laser. It is best just to wail on it here. Close
to the end, it'll simply be a floating torso -- deplete the rest of its HP.

Limits and Drives are good options for this battle.

For winning, Sora's max HP is upped by five and he learns Finishing Leap;
Donald learns Jackpot; Goofy's max HP is upped by five; and Jack's max HP is
increases by ten.


After the battle, you'll get the Decisive Pumpking, a Keyblade.

From here, you can go to the Pride Lands (Section XXXVIII), Agrabah (Section
XXXV), or the 100 Acre Wood (with the Torn Pages of Agrabah) (Section XXXVI).

After arriving and seeing Scar's ghost, go to Pride Rock and talk to some of
the lionesses. After that, head into the King's Den and talk to Simba. After
talking with you, he decides to do something about it.

For some reason, after the scene, you'll learn Running Tackle. While Dashing,
use the Attack command. It helps, I guess.

After the scene, leave and head into the Stone Hollow to speak with Rafiki.
After some wise words, Rafiki will send Simba off to see the hyenas, who are
in the Elephant Graveyard. Go there now for a boss.

============================
BOSS: Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed
============================

This battle, although it cannot be easily lost (if at all), can easily last a
very long time. The hyenas are very quick, so you're going to need to chase
them while Dashing. This is where the Running Tackle ability is key.

First, find a hyena and lock-on to it. Follow it and, when you're in range,
use Thundara. This will make them fly into the air and stay still for a minute.
Alternately, just get in range and hit it with Running Tackle. Either way,
you'll be able to pull off a combo or two. After that, the hyena will likely
run off. Chase after it and do this with the rest.

For winning, Sora gets an accessory slot; Donald's max HP is upped by four;
Goofy learns MP Rage; and Simba gets five more HP.


After the battle and scene, head back to Pride Rock to find Simba. It turns
out that he isn't there, but at the Oasis. Head all of the way back there and
Simba will decide to confront his fears. You'll be back at Pride Rock. There,
use the Save Point and equip some Thunder resistant gear and take off Simba's
Auto-Limit if it's on. Leave the area to encounter your next boss.

==================
BOSS: Groundshaker
==================

From the start, Sora will begin (automatically) running. You will have to
activate some Reaction Commands to save your HP bar. They start with Leaps.
After that, you'll use Fend (Triangle REPEATEDLY) to try to stun the beast. If
you succeed, you'll be able to hit the eye of the stunned creature before it
rises back up into the air.

After this, it'll jump away and start shooting strong, hard-to-dodge lightning
at you (which is why I recommended Thunder resistance). Dash towards the boss
while trying to dodge the bolts. When you get near the head or feet, use the
Reaction Command twice to get onto its back.

There, you'll find another weakness of the Groundshaker. Hit it quite a few
times to have it roll to your side. Jump off now: there is more lightning and
the boss gets kinda rowdy. Once it calms down some, get back onto the back as
before.

After a while, the thing on the back will go into its head and the eyes are
once more vulnerable, so hit 'em. The Groundshaker will soon proceed to freak
out, sending many shockwaves, fire, and stomps your way. GET UNDER A FOOT and
use Fend to stun it as at the start. Use Wildcat to deplete some HP quickly.

This cycle will continue until the boss is gone.

For winning, Sora gets a Thunder upgrade (to Thundaga) and five more HP; Simba
also has his max HP upped by five.


You can either complete Atlantica now (Section XXXIX), finish the unfinished
100 Acre Wood from earlier (Section XXXVI), or continue to Hollow Bastion and
the Space Paranoids (Section XL).

After obtaining the spell Thundaga, return here and talk to Sebastian to begin
the fifth and final musical.

This musical has a mixture of all the gauges you've seen thus far, so I'll go
over them real quick:

-- X encircled by blue -> orange -> yellow gauge. For a better score, you'll
   want the gauge emptied into the yellow when you press X.
-- Triangle encircled by green -> orange -> yellow gauge. As with the previous,
   wait until the yellow to press TRIANGLE.
-- Ariel/Sebastian encircled by pink -> orange -> yellow gauge. Wait until the
   gauge is in the yellow for better scores. If the figure is Ariel, DO press
   Square. If not, DO NOT press Square.
-- X encircled by purplish gauge. This will get you lots of points. When this
   appears, repeatedly press X.

To complete this musical, you'll need a score of 30,000. It is easy enough.

For finishing Atlantica fully (which you now have done), you'll have a Blizzard
upgrade (to Blizzaga) and an Orichalcum+ (!!).

From here, either finish the 100 Acre Wood (Section XXXVI) or go on to the
Hollow Bastion and the Space Paranoids (Section XL).

You start out in Hollow Bastion, although it has been infested by Space
Paranoids enemies. Go out in front of Merlin's House to find your first group
of them -- some Strafers and a Devastator. After the battle, Yuffie will take
you inside Merlin's House. There, you find that the MCP has become a bit of a
big problem by using Ansem's machinery to create Heartless. In addition, the
town's defense system has become haywire and annoying in general.

So then, you'll have to go to Ansem's Computer Room. Along the way, you'll find
some skateboards to help you speed along past enemies. Whether you choose to
fight or not is your choice. In the computer room, Leon will give you a new
Keyblade: the Sleeping Lion.

Before entering the computer world, go through the newly-opened door on the
right. Here, you'll find Hollow Bastion's last chest, in which you'll find the
Cosmic Chain. After grabbing it, enter the Space Paranoids.

Inside the Pit Cell, use the Save Point and Moogle Shop as wished, then use the
terminal to go the Light Cycle. There, you'll fight some Heartless (a Limit
will help greatly) and you'll save Tron. After a quick scene, go to the I/O
Tower. (Exit the Canyon to the north, then exit to the east for the com room.)

While the program is uploading, a huge group of Heartless will strike, with
many Devastators. Master Form and Tron's Limit are the optimal things to use,
especially at the end, when three Devastators attack.

After the battle, go to the Communications Room. There, Cid's prgram will let
you use the Simulation Hanger and defeat the MCP. Tron will also get some
abilities. In the hallway, exit to the west.

In the Hangar, go up to the ship and use the console to Depart. As you solar
sail, you'll fight Heartless. This, like the previous battle, is fairly tough.
Also, aside from the enemies themselves, you'll need to get rid of them before
the solar sailer can't take the weight. As before, I prefer Tron's Limit and
Master Form.

For winning, Sora, Goofy, and Tron will have their max HP raised by five;
Donald will learn MP Hastera.

Once the ship comes to a stop, go around the area and grab the four chests. In
them, you'll find an AP Boost, an Orichalcum+, a Central Computer Core Map, and
a Cosmic Arts. Use the Shop...

              ... AND, FOR GOODNESS SAKE, USE THE SAVE POINT!!!

Exit to the north to the new area, where you'll encounter Sark and the MCP. Yow
will first fight Sark, although he is easy. However, when the MCP transfers its
data to Sark...

======================
BOSS: Sark and the MCP
======================

Start with Sark. Whack at this to make him kneel over, which will let you hit
the head.

Once Sark is out of the way, turn your focus onto the MCP. Break away a wall
segment and use the Reaction Command to use Tron's Deletion program. You'll
want to hit Triangle as much as possible to eliminate more HP. Eventually,
though, the walls will rise and fall, creating lasers to stop the Deletion
process. Sark will be restored after this. Always take care of him. Always.

After a while, the MCP will spin the walls when you break one, so you'll
probably not get to the hole. Instead, break several wall segments while the
MCP heals Sark.

              O===============================================O
              |               GLITCH WARNING!!!               |
              O-----------------------------------------------O
              |  If you are KO'ed while the Deletion process  |
              |  occurs, the game freezes and hangs. You'll   |
              |  have to reset the game. As such, I did say   |
              |  to save beforehand. Another precaution is to |
              |  keep your HP at around 50+%. It also helps   |
              |  to take care of Sark before even trying to   |
              |  use Delete on the MCP.                       |
              O===============================================O

For winning, Sora's max HP increases by five and you get a Reflect upgrade (to
Reflega); Donald's max HP is upped by four; Goofy gets an accessory slot; Tron
has his max HP upped by five.

Okay then, all that is left is Twilight Town and future.

Seeing as we have quite a few new treasures, let's go treasure hunting. First,
exit the station and go into the Underground Concourse (the doorway with the
number 5 above it). There, you'll find many Nobodies -- and chests. One on the
left wall hasa Mythril Gem; one on the right wall has a Mythril Crystal; and
the middle rooms have two chests: AP Boost and an Orichalcum.

Exit the Concourse to the south to reach the Tunnelway. The chest in the main
room has an Orichalcum. Continue to the exit to find a Mythril Crystal. Exit to
Sunset Terrace.

There, jump onto the trolley, then to the chest on the rooftop on the east side
of the tracks to find an Orichalcum+ (!!). Jump down and to the left, you'll
find a Mythril Crystal. Go to the western part of the tracks and look behind
some crates to find a Mythril Shard. Now, remember that dead-end alley where
balls shoot out from the wall? The chest there has an AP Boost.

Now, go to the Tunnelway, to the Concourse, exit through door #4 (Tram Common),
through the hole in the wall to the Woods, then into the Old Mansion.

There, you'll find Hayner, Pence, and Olette, who've had a bad run-in with some
Nobodies. As the mystery deepens, more Nobodies and King Mickey appears. It is
not too tough of a fight.

For winning, though, Sora's and Goofy's max HP is upped by five; Donald learns
Lucky Lucky.

Now, inside the Mansion, you'll find some more chests. Near the glass doors at
the back, you'll find a Mythril Crystal. If you go through the left door into
the Dining Room, you'll find a Mythril Stone and a Mythril Crystal. In the
Foyer again, on the right staircase, you'll find a Mythril Stone. On the
balcony is an Elixir. Use the Save Point in the White Room (left room on the
second floor) if you wish, then go into the Library (right room on the second
floor).

There, the floor is still lower, so you'll be able to go down the stairs. Grab
the chest (Orichalcum) as you go, then downstairs and through the door.

You'll find a computer terminal and Pence takes care of the technical stuff.
However, you'll find that the ice cream was a clue (and not melten/eaten by
Donald). Since the ice cream is Sea-Salt Ice Cream... However, before telling
Pence the password, head into the basement hall past Olette, then into the
Basement Corridor. You'll find this world's last chest: the Ultimate Recipe!

Now, return and tell Pence the password (Sea-Salt Ice Cream) and the little
beam in the alcove lights up. Touch it to be sent to the alternate Twilight
Town, built specially for Roxas. You'll also get Secret Ansem's Report #10.

In the [alternate] Basement Hall, you'll find a portal into the dark realm.
You are FORCED to go there -- you cannot check on the alternate Twilight Town
by any means whatsoever. Head in when ready.

Before Sora can really figure out where he is (look at the wall(s)!), some
Dusks attack. An new ally -- you should know who -- will appear to help you.
Another battle is fought against some Dusks and Assassins, but they are weak
compared to your duo.

For winning, you'll get the Bond of Flame Keyblade, 10 more MP for Sora, and
access to....

Head into the first area of the city: the Fragment Crossing. There are almost a
literal infinite number of Shadows here (there a just about 100 or so). Pick
some off to level up Wisdom Form. The first chest is in a dark corner (Mythril
Stone). The dark corner opposite has another chest (Mythril Crystal). Just
before leaving, you'll find two more chests (AP Boost, Orichalcum). Leave the
area for a cool scene (and fight, in Final Mix), after which you'll get Secret
Ansem's Report #8.

In the skyscraper area, look to the right to find wreckage, near which you'll
find an AP Boost. On the other side of the skyscraper, you'll find a Mythril
Stone and Mythril Crystal. Go into the next area.

Also, by now, you may want to use Forms a lot more. Why? You may transform
into the ultimate Form: Final Form! Transform into THAT often and you'll never
get Anti-Form again. Although, I must admit, the chances of getting Final Form
are random.

There, you'll find a Save Point and Moogle Shop; use them as you wish. The
chest near the Moogle Shop will yield a Dark City Map. DO NOT MISS THE
OUTCROPPING AS YOU LEAVE -- IT HAS AN ORICHALCUM+! Go into the castle when
you are ready.

In the castle, you'll often fight Nobodies -- lots and lots of Nobodies. The
first you encounter is the new Sorcerer. They can make translucent cubes that
they use offensively and defensively. You can hit them all-out; Retaliating
Slash is a big help against them.

Anywho, in the first area of the castle itself, you'll find a chest on the
raised platform (Orichalcum). Go further along to find some Sorcerers and a
Sniper. Once they're done, pick up the Mythril Gem next to the doorway.

The next area, Crooked Ascension, is basically an elevator. As you go up, you
will fight some Dragoons. They shouldn't provide much trouble. If they do, go
ahead and use a Limit or two.

In the next area, you'll find a Save Point and Moogle Shop. Use both and
continue into the Hall of Empty Melodies. There, you'll finally fight Xigbar.

============
BOSS: Xigbar
============

As soon as the battle start, Xigbar will teleport to a high balcony and attempt
to snipe Sora. Dodge left and right until you can use the Reaction Command
Break. Follow it up with some Warp Snipes and Xigbar will get into the fray.

Xigbar likes to teleport and he likes to shoot. And guess what? He'll do both
a lot. However, he'll have to reload eventually! Use Guard to reflect his
lasers at him -- it works better than hacking at him until he reloads: hack on
him then.

When Xigbar eventually turns the field where there are some gaps, you'll either
need to Guard from his lasers or run around and get lucky.

Xigbar will sometimes shoot a large projectile at you. Use Warp Snipe when it
is coming at you to do damage to him. This usually happens when he has about
70% of his HP left.

When he is down to about 40% HP, he'll say "You're gonna pay!" and change the
field. The field becomes a tiny square. Xigbar will teleport around and shoot
at you. You can either use Reflega or run around constantly in a circle. Even
when he returns to the middle platform, continue running around or risk death.

As the wears on more, Xigbar will get faster and more aggressive. Try to
use more and more of Warp Snipe, and you may want to risk a Drive when you can
actually hit him. Limits aren't so good: you'll need MP for healing. Just
hurry and finish it fast!

For winning, Sora will get Magnega; Donald will get an item slot; and Goofy's
max HP will increase by five.


After the battle, you'll get Secret Ansem's Report #3. Continue on to the next
area. There, open the nearby chest for a Mythril Gem. Continue along the ramp,
amidst the many Creepers (good leveling for Final Form). About halfway up,
you'll find a Mythril Crystal. Get onto the shadowed platform to find another
Orichalcum. Go into the next area.

After some scenes, you'll get the Oblivion Keyblade and the Castle That Never
Was Map. Continue to the next area, the Proof of Existence.

Here, there is a lock on the other side of the room. Until members II - XII are
eliminated (to my knowledge), the lock stays locked. Use the Save Point and go
into the first area.

============
BOSS: Luxord
============

This battle is different. Both you and Luxord have a TIME Gauge at the top of
the screen. If you lose all of your TIME or HP, you lose; the same for Luxord.
Your partners will not fight.

The battle starts with Sora being turned into a die. Stay away from Luxord
until you revert (when the Drive Gauge hits zero).

Once you're Sora again, you'll want to watch the TIME Gauges. You can attack
Luxord to lower his. You'll play some games with him that'll do stuff.

One is a card game. When he challenges you, run to him and use the Reaction
Command. Cards will spin around you and the command window spins with Xs and
an O. You'll want to hit the O as the thing slows. If you hit the O, Luxord
loses a fair deal of time; hitting X or taking too long turns you into a card.
If you lose, stay away from him.

Another game: Luxord will turn into a card and you'll have to find him. You can
use the camera to figure out the card. If you flip a blank, nothing happens. If
you flip fireballs, you'll lose HP. If you flip a clock, you'll lose TIME. If
you flip Luxord, he'll lose some time.

When Luxord is almost out of TIME, he'll litter the ground with many, many
cards. He'll then teleport around and slice at you with the cards. Eventually,
he'll teleport to the other side of the arena and you'll automatically come to
him. A wall of cards will appear around Sora and you'll try to hit the Os, not
Xs, in each of the four menus. If you get all four Os, you'll fling the cards
at Luxord, usually finishing him. If you fail, you'll lose a lot of time.

After Luxord is out of time, attack him to end it.

Sora will get five more HP to his max HP for winning.


After defeating Luxord, you'll receive Secret Ansem's Report #9. Return to the
Proof of Existence, use the Save Point, and go into the new room to fight Saix.

==========
BOSS: Saix
==========

Firstly, you'll notice the Berserk bar in the corner. If it is filled, Saix
will go crazy and attack all over the place. You'll get hit, but the attacks
aren't too strong.

When he does use such attacks, he drop his weapon in places. Pick it up. You
now can easily chase Saix and not be damaged by him during this time. You can
also hit him with the Reaction Commands. If you do a full combo while like this
with the Reaction Commands, you'll empty his Berserk bar.

When this bar is empty, it is easy. Switch into your strongest Form (Final if
possible) or use Limits like mad to take off lots and lots of life. You can
still use dropped weapons -- the combos take off about a whole HP bar.

One tip: stay out of the corners. If Saix goes berserk with you in the corner,
you may as well hit that Soft Reset combination.

For winning, Sora's Drive Gauge is upped by one; Donald's HP is upped by four;
and Goofy gets another item slot.


After the battle, you'll get Secret Ansem's Report #12. Return to the Proof of
Existence and use the Save Point, then exit to the north.

After the scene there, you'll get Secret Ansem's Report #11 and a new ally.

Anywho, go up through Naught's Approach (straightforward there) to Ruin and
Creation's Passage. This area has invisible paths, but they don't curve and
you can't fall off into the bottomless abyss. The first platform you get to has
a Mythril Stone; the second has an AP Boost; the third has a Mythril Crystal;
and the fourth has an Orichalcum. There is nothing much else here, except a lot
of Nobodies. Exit the area for some scenes and a solo fight against the sole
remaining member (in a sense) of Organization XIII: Xemnas.

============
BOSS: Xemnas
============

When the battle starts, Xemnas will cast a dark shroud or something onto Sora
and go to the top of skyscraper. This shroud will deplete your HP, so go up
quick to the skyscraper and use Facedown, the Reaction Command. You'll see Sora
and Xemnas run closer and closer together. Ignore the first two Reaction
Commands that appear (Clash, Break Through) and use Finish to really let 'im
have it.

Back on the ground, Xemnas will display what is probably copyright infringement
and attack you with his light swords. He'll also zip around when shrouded. He
can shroud himself and move next to you -- when he does, Guard or you'll take a
good chunk of damage. When he swings from a distance, try to dodge away from it
rather than Guarding -- it's tough.

It barely changes later in battle. The only real change is that Xemnas will use
a shield before attacking. When he does, just move back.

For winning, Sora's MP increases by 10.


After the battle and scene, you'll receive Secret Ansem's Report #13. Now, the
way to Kingdom Hearts will appear. Should you go in there, there will be no
coming back except for the save file you create before leaving. It is very
recommended to do some sidequests and synthesis and journal stuff.

Once you decide to enter, there is no going back. Good luck, and Godspeed.
Save before opting to enter.

As the initial battle begins after the scene, you'll find building popping out
of the ground and they get closer to you. As they get closer, use the Reaction
Command Slicer to get through. Continue running to the next area. There, run
forward until you rise on a platform. Continue forward and, when you see
Escablade appear, use it. Perform Sky Scraper several times to reach a boss.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
FINAL BOSS, Part 1: The Cores
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

There will be three health bars at the top of the screen. From left to right,
they represent the health of the left, center, and right cores.

At the start, you'll be on the right core. The charge bar in the middle will
show how long you have until a massive blast of energy shoots at you. From such
a distance, you cannot reach the core. However, you CAN knock enemies into the
cores by hitting them. These enemies look like the explosive ones from the
Gummi Routes. It is fairly simple.

After a message appears telling you to jump to the other core, usually because
the core will soon attack, use Stunt Dodge. The beam is very powerful and can
easily KO you if you're not at full HP. You'll also be prompted to go to the
other core when its HP is out. This explosion will kill you. Once both cores
are gone, you'll go to the center one.

At the moment upon landing at the central core, little is happening. Run up to
it and wail on it. Soon, it will put up a shield and Nobodies will come and
attack. Defeat the Nobodies to put the shield down and allow you to resume
attacking. Eventually, some parts of the structure will try to slam upon you.
Staying to the sides is a good way to avoid them. When the core's HP is gone,
use the Triangle button to Proceed.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
FINAL BOSS, Part 2: Xemnas on the Throne
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

After proceeding, you get stuck in a battle. In this one, you'll fight an
armored figure on a throne. I have presumed it to be Xemnas. He'll use attacks
quite like the Organization members used in KH2 (there are some in Chain of
Memories and 358/2 Days, but don't worry too much of them). Xemnas is quite
fond of knocking you back, so you'll probably be unable to deal damage for
long periods of time. Use such times to heal, although sparingly. When you CAN
attack, Final Form and Riku's Limit are very good options.

FYI, you may wanna heal yourself near the end.

After the scene resulting from his defeat...

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
FINAL BOSS, Part 3: Big Flying Dragon Thing
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Yeah, yeah, you come up with something better...

For this, you and Riku are on a tiny ship fighting some big dragon thing. In
this part, you are unable to heal yourself. You can use Circle to absorb lasers
and convert them to Energy, Square to shoot lasers, X to attack with the
Keyblade, Triangle to use Megalaser when prompted, and the Left Analog Stick to
move around. Got it?

For the first bit, let the little ships attack and abosrb their lasers. Use
Square to hurt the dragon when no ships are around. Use Megalaser to deal a lot
of damage, if you can.

Once the tail is gone, you'll be attacked by laser-shooting snowflakes. They
HURT a lot. Move circularly to get away from them. Riku will move you closer to
a core now, and some of the explosives from the core battle will appear. You
should attack them with the Keyblade to knock them into the core. Also try to
charge the Megalaser to, as before, deal a lot of damage. However, you should
wait until the core is in front of you. The laser-shooters from earlier may
also appear. Repeat this for the second core.

Next are the wings. The laser-shooters will appear more often here. You'll also
be hitting the explosives into the wings. Megalaser is a good aid in this part
of the battle.

After defeating both of the wings...

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
FINAL BOSS, Part 4: Xemnas on the Throne (again)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

You'll be fighting Xemnas on his throne again, but it is only you and Riku, so
Final Form is out of the question. A new thing, though, it that you can Glide
(Square) and infinitely Aerial Dodge (Circle). Good thing, too: you can fall
off the platform! Fight as you normally would initially.

When you get thrown WAY back (towards the black hole thing), Glide back. On
the way, avoid the stationary buildings and go to one that is stationary. You
will probably be shot at with lasers, so be careful. When you get to the
stationary building, use the Reaction Commands Riding Shot and Meteor Rain to
break the giant shield. Go back and resume the attack. Now is a preferable time
to use Riku's Limit. Why not at the start?

Well, see, Xemnas will knock you away at set HP amounts (unless it was on
timing, in which case I battled at the same exact speed five times). Therefore,
right after being knocked away is when you have the most "HP room" to use the
Session Limit. The damage from a Limit, etc., will stop at such a knock-off
point.

After THAT battle...
_________________________________________________________________
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
FINAL BOSS, Part 5: Organization XIII Leader/Member No. I, Xemnas 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Square just loves extremely long series of final bosses, eh? This is the last
one!

The final battle starts fairly hectic. Sora will be hurled into the air and
lots of the energy beams (like those in the Twilight Thorn battle WAAAY back)
will appear. Continually hit Triangle to use Reversal. Don't even worry about
Xemnas, there are too many. The onslaught will end when Xemnas drops to the
ground.

When he does, you'll deal with some more attacks. One such move has him move
around fast, leaving images of himself. You'll know which one he is when he
attacks, so be quick with Guard. Lock-on to him and follow him, hitting him
when possible. This will go on for a while.

After some time, Xemnas will become nearly impossible to hit and use a lot
of laser attacks. Use jumps, Guards, and Riku's shield to protect yourself.

Later on, Xemnas will trap Sora and say, "Can you spare... a heart?" and you
will gain control of Riku. You are now under the influence of Riku's HP gauge,
not Sora's (quite a few people get mixed up) and he usually has less than Sora.
You need to run to Sora and save him from losing all of his HP (or Game Over),
and it doesn't take very long. Xemnas will keep getting in the way. Use Dark
Aura to knock him back. When you reach Sora, use Rescue, then wail on the
stunned Xemnas.

When Xemnas is down to his last HP bar, you and Riku are encased in a dark
sphere to defend yourself from -- literally -- THOUSANDS of lasers. Hit both
Triangle (Riku?) and X (Sora?) to block them. I suggest rotating the controller
about ninety degrees and pressing both buttons rapidly with your thumbs or your
preferred finger(s). If they hit you, your doom has been virtually spelled out.
After this, you'll find a few good quick scenes, which do some damage.

After the above, Xemnas should be very low on HP (probably 1 HP?), so just use
Thundaga when you can to end it.


And thus, you have beaten Kingdom Hearts II. You'll see the secret movie (if
you were on Proud or filled out the Journal completely on Standard) and then
your Battle Report. Congrats!

I prefer to take out Yuffie first, because she can get annoying with her long
range attack and she is fast. Leon isn't as much trouble, except for when his
Gunblade gets to a much longer length. I think he can also shoot fireballs. It
is still a somewhat easy fight, but Limits are a big help.


For winning this tournament, you'll get the Lucky Ring and a Serenity Stone.

As with Match #5, it'll help to grab the Berserker's weapon and beat them up
with it. After that, focus on the Dancers. A Summon isn't too bad.


O========================O---------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #10  |  ENEMIES: Hercules  |
O========================O---------------------O

Herc isn't too hard. You can easily dodge most of his attacks. However, he
will be invincible quite a bit, so back off from him until he is vulnerable
again. It isn't too good an idea to use a Summon because of the unpredictable
invincibility.


For winning, you'll the Genji Shield (for Goofy), and the Skillful Ring.

|  GODDESS OF FATE CUP: MATCH #6  |  ENEMIES: Fat Bandit (x1), Large Body (x1)|
O=================================O-------------------------------------------O

For this, you have only 30 seconds to win. Fantasia, Trinity Limit, or Wisdom
Form (if you are powerful enough) are the best options. If you cannot use any,
avoid physical attacks.


O=================================O-------------------------------------------O
|  GODDESS OF FATE CUP: MATCH #7  |  ENEMIES: Lance Soldier (x2),             |

O=================================O-------------------------------------------O

As with Match #3, you'll have those points. Magic is preferable to a Limit and
the like.


O=================================O-------------------------------------------O
|  GODDESS OF FATE CUP: MATCH #8  |  ENEMIES: Very, very many Rapid Thrusters |
O=================================O-------------------------------------------O

Merely survive until time is out. Use Magnega to kill them fast, if you wish.


O=================================O-------------------------------------------O
|  GODDESS OF FATE CUP: MATCH #9  |  ENEMIES: Bolt Tower (x2), Hot Rod (x2)   |

|  GODDESS OF FATE CUP: MATCH #10  |  ENEMIES: Hades and some Hammer Frames   |
O=================================O-------------------------------------------O

Unlike the norm, Hades will not become invincible or red, so he's quite a
pushover. Ignore the Hammer Frames: they help in no way. Trinity Limit, a
Berserk Charge, and Valor/Master/Final Forms are all good ways to finish this.


Winning nets you the Fatal Crest Keyblade and an Orichalcum+!

O==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>=O==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>===O

In this cup, you can use Limits and they take up less MP, but the Drive Gauge
is disabled.

O==============================O---------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #1  |  ENEMIES: Shadow (x5), Hook Bat (x5)  |
O==============================O---------------------------------------O

A fairly basic fight. Not worth wasting a Limit.


O==============================O----------------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #2  |  ENEMIES: Large Body (x1), Minute Bomb (x6)  |
O==============================O----------------------------------------------O

A fairly basic fight. Not worth wasting a Limit.


O==============================O-----------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #3  |  ENEMIES: Rabid Dog (x5), Soldier (x2)  |
O==============================O-----------------------------------------O

A fairly basic fight. Not worth wasting a Limit.


O==============================O--------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #4  |  ENEMIES: Hot Rod (x2), Shadow (x4)  |
O==============================O--------------------------------------O

A Limit may help out, mostly due to the Hot Rods.


O==============================O----------------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #5  |  ENEMIES: Rapid Thruster (x5), Hook Bat (x4),|
|                              |           Bolt Tower (x2)                    |
O==============================O----------------------------------------------O

A fairly basic fight. Not worth wasting a Limit.


O==============================O----------------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #6  |  ENEMIES: Gargoyle Warrior (x3),             |
|                              |           Minute Bomb (x4),                  |
|                              |           Lance Soldier (x4)                 |
O==============================O----------------------------------------------O

A fairly basic fight. Not worth wasting a Limit.


O==============================O----------------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #7  |  ENEMIES: Soldier (x2), Aeroplane (x6),      |
|                              |           Rabid Dog (x1), Assault Rider (x2) |
O==============================O----------------------------------------------O

A Limit is a good option, here.


O==============================O---------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #8  |  ENEMIES: Rapid Thruster (x [a lot])  |
O==============================O---------------------------------------O

You're alone for this fight, and you only fight for a minute, like at the Land
of Dragons. Just survive.


O==============================O----------------------------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #9  |  ENEMIES: Gargoyle Knight (x2),              |
|                              |           Creeper Plant (x4)                 |
O==============================O----------------------------------------------O

A fairly basic fight. Not worth wasting a Limit.


O===============================O----------------------------O
|  PAIN & PANIC CUP: MATCH #10  |  ENEMIES: Leon and Yuffie  |
O===============================O----------------------------O

I prefer to take out Yuffie first, because she can get annoying with her long
range attack and she is fast. Leon isn't as much trouble, except for when his
Gunblade gets to a much longer length. I think he can also shoot fireballs. It
is still a somewhat easy fight, but Limits are a big help.

O==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>=O==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>===O

For this one, you can use Drive Forms alone and the Drive Gauge fills faster,
but, as I said, you fight alone.

O==========================O----------------------------------------------O
|  CERBERUS CUP: MATCH #1  |  ENEMIES: Air Pirate (x2), Trick Ghost (x2)  |
O==========================O----------------------------------------------O

This fight is fairly basic. Master/Final Form is preferred to speed things
along.

O==========================O-----------------------------O
|  CERBERUS CUP: MATCH #8  |  ENEMIES: Luna Bandit (x5)  |
O==========================O-----------------------------O

This battle is fought in a darkened area. Nevertheless, a Form will still do
you well. I'd prefer to use Wisdom Form, so you'll be able to use a Form from
the next battle's beginning.


O==========================O------------------------------------------------O
|  CERBERUS CUP: MATCH #9  |  ENEMIES: Emerald Blues (x4), Fat Bandit (x1)  |
O==========================O------------------------------------------------O

This battle also is fought in a dark area. Seeing as you probably aren't going
to see the Fat Bandit easily, I'd seriously consider using Wisdom Form.


O===========================O---------------------O
|  CERBERUS CUP: MATCH #10  |  ENEMIES: Cerberus  |
O===========================O---------------------O

This battle is virtually the same as the last one, except that Auron is not
with you and the room is darkened. Freely use Final Form; it'll help greatly.

 O==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==O==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>===O

Summons can be used alone (because you are). However, you have 500 points in
a separate, un-refillable health meter. They empty based on the damage taken.
If it hits zero, you lose.

O=======================O------------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #1  |  ENEMIES: Magnum Loader (x2), Dusk (x3)  |
O=======================O------------------------------------------O

Pretty basic fight. Don't worry about Summoning.


O=======================O---------------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #2  |  ENEMIES: Assassin (x4), Morning Star (x1)  |
O=======================O---------------------------------------------O

Pretty basic fight. Don't worry about Summoning.


O=======================O-----------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #3  |  ENEMIES: Strafer (x4), Berserker (x2)  |
O=======================O-----------------------------------------O

The Beserkers can make it tough. Try grabbing their weapon to use it against
them. If you cannot, a Summon may help you out.


O=======================O------------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #4  |  ENEMIES: Trick Ghost (x3), Sniper (x2)  |
O=======================O------------------------------------------O

Pretty basic fight. Don't worry about Summoning.


O=======================O----------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #5  |  ENEMIES: Dancer (x3), Neoshadow (x3)  |
O=======================O----------------------------------------O

Try to take out the Dancers first, as they'll grab your head and do a bunch of
damage. Don't worry about Summoning unless you get in bad trouble, though.


O=======================O----------------------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #6  |  ENEMIES: Bookmaster (x1), Air Pirate (x2),        |

O=======================O----------------------------------------------------O

Pretty basic fight. Don't worry about Summoning.


O=======================O--------------------------------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #7  |  ENEMIES: Crimson Jazz (x2), Samurai (x2)  |
O=======================O--------------------------------------------O

O=======================O----------------------------------------------------O

As with Match #5, it'll help to grab the Berserker's weapon and beat them up
with it. After that, focus on the Dancers. A Summon isn't too bad.


O========================O---------------------O
|  TITAN CUP: MATCH #10  |  ENEMIES: Hercules  |
O========================O---------------------O

Herc isn't too hard. You can easily dodge most of his attacks. However, he
will be invincible quite a bit, so back off from him until he is vulnerable
again. It isn't too good an idea to use a Summon because of the unpredictable
invincibility.

O==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==O==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==<>==O

I won't get too in-depth on this, except certain battles. Why? Well, firstly,
THIS IS HARD. So hard that, when you get here, most enemies aren't worth any
mention. Secondly, I'm lazy. Also to note, I only listed the enemies that
really mattered, mainly because a lot of species can appear in one battle.

It is preferred to come here at Lv. 90+ with the Ultima Weapon, Final Form, and
some very good abilities equipped. It is possible to do it at lower levels (I
managed barely at Lv. 73).

~~ For matches 1 - 10, there aren't specific rules.
~~ In matches 11 - 20, you fight as in the Titan Cup.
~~ In matches 21 - 30, you fight as in the Pain & Panic Cup.
~~ In matches 31 - 40, you fight as in the Cerberus Cup. You also have ten
   minutes to get to round forty.
~~ In matches 41 - 50, it is just Sora. No allies, summons, or Drives. Just
   Sora.

|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #5  | ENEMIES: Volcanic Lord                          |
O===========================O-------------------------------------------------O

Remember Agrabah? This, but easier.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #10  | ENEMIES: Tifa, Yuffie                          |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Tifa is new, and pretty tough. Getting away when she is about to attack will
help greatly, especially if you come in for a few combos soon after. Yuffie is
not really worth mention. I'd use a Limit, like Duck Flare, here.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #14  | ENEMIES: Lance Soldiers, and others            |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Finish 'em, fast! I guess a Genie with Final Form might help. The main worry
are the Lance Soldiers when they get low on HP. Then again, Magnega may help...


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #15  | ENEMIES: Blizzard Lord                         |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Same as Agrabah, except you want to not even get close to being hit.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #17  | ENEMIES: Aerial Knockers, and others           |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Magnega is your best move, here.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #19  | ENEMIES: Assassins, and others                 |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Again, Magnega or a Summon.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #20  | ENEMIES: Pete                                  |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Pete loves to use his shield, and has a lot of HP. He also can use a shockwave
attack. Hits from behind minimize the risk of being hit.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #24  | ENEMIES: Bulky Vendor (x3)                     |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

This is like a restorative round. Heal yourself and let the MP recharge. Nab
the Bulky Vendors during Prime Capsule for a lot of points.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #25  | ENEMIES: Cloud, Tifa                           |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

I tend to use Trinity Limit or Duck Flare here.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #30  | ENEMIES: Hades                                 |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Goofy's Limits are a huge help.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #32  | ENEMIES: Dancers, and some others              |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Wisdom is good if you want to keep your distance; Final Form helps to finish it
fast.

O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #34  | ENEMIES: Sorcerers, and some others            |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Wisdom is good if you want to keep your distance; Final Form helps to finish it
fast.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #35  | ENEMIES: Lotsa Rapid Thrusters                 |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Magnega is the very best option here.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #36  | ENEMIES: Berserker (x3)                        |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Combo one to grab its weapon and use it fast!


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #37  | ENEMIES: Lotsa Nobodies                        |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Final Form: always a big help.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #38  | ENEMIES: Dancers, Sorcerer, some others?       |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Final Form still helps.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #40  | ENEMIES: Leon, Cloud                           |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Final Form also works here. Use Master/Valor forms as alternates. Focus on
Cloud, first, though.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #41  | ENEMIES: Toy Soldiers, Graveyards              |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Glide in and combo a few times, then get away, and continue. It's tedious, but
you won't be nearly as likely to be KO'ed.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #42  | ENEMIES: Living Bones, Fortunetellers          |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

The Glide-in-and-strike tactic works here, too. Dispel is VERY helpful.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #43  | ENEMIES: Large Bodies, Morning Stars           |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Focus on the Morning Stars first. Use Bump and other Reaction Commands when
possible. Thundaga is also helpful.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #44  | ENEMIES: Living Bones                          |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Immediately get at a distance and zap them with Thundaga: it is very hard.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #45  | ENEMIES: 1,000 Heartless!?!?                   |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

A timed 1,000 Heartless battle. You'll just have to last out the time. Use
Magnega and Reaction Commands to help some.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #46  | ENEMIES: Hot Rods, Devastator                  |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Start with the Devastator. After that, use magic on the Hot Rods.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #47  | ENEMIES: Lance Soldiers, Living Bone,          |
|                            |          Emerald Blues, Assault Riders,        |
|                            |          Morning Stars, Crescendos             |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

After the Bulky Vendor is gone, you'll fight some Lance Soldiers and a Living
Bone; focus on the latter first. Once they're gone, you'll fight some Emerald
Blues. After THEM, you'll fight some Assault Riders: use magic from a distance.
After THAT, you'll fight some Morning Stars and Crescendos; focus first on the
former. After them, use the Crescendos for some self-healing, then wipe them
out. *whew!*


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #48  | ENEMIES: Cerberus                              |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Pretty easy, finally. Try to end with a lot of HP and MP.


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #49  | ENEMIES: Cloud, Leon, Tifa, Yuffie             |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

(!) Firstly, Leon is always in his "limit" form. After noticing this, go right
to Tifa, since she is very annoying sometimes. Cloud will also be annoying,
with his flying-and-slashing technique. Try to use such a technique as well,
and you might have a chance. After fighting Tifa, go to Cloud, then Leon, then
Yuffie. Good luck...


O============================O------------------------------------------------O
|  THE HADES CUP: MATCH #50  | ENEMIES: Hades                                 |
O============================O------------------------------------------------O

Yay! An ally (Hercules)! You'll be fighting as you did on your second visit to
Olympus. Make him vulnerable with Aura Sphere, then Trinity him!

This world requires the Torn Pages. There are five sets that can be found
after the book is received. Go to the book and enter to have a set sown in.
You cannot use two at once -- you'll have to go from one to the other. The
Torn Pages are found in:

~~ Disney Castle: Library
~~ Pride Lands: Oasis
~~ Hollow Bastion: Crystal Fissure
~~ Land of Dragons: Throne Room
~~ Agrabah: Ruined Chamber

Also note that these can be used in any order. So, without further ado, here
is the walkthrough!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>
TORN PAGES #1

 ___________________
|  Items Checklist  \
|____________________\______________________________________________________
|  AP Boost ........................................................... []  |
|  Defense Boost ...................................................... []  |
|  Mythril Gem ........................................................ []  |
|___________________________________________________________________________|

When you enter the book, the Torn Pages will reassert themselves with the book,
revealing the next area: Piglet's House. Head there and open the three chests
in the area (AP Boost, Defense Boost, Mythril Gem).

Once you're ready, go over to Piglet to rescue him. A gust of wind will
promptly send him flying off, and then Sora has rescue him by holding on to a
balloon. Pooh comes too.

This initiates a minigame called "A Blustery Rescue". Sora and Pooh will be
riding on a balloon in a side-scrolling area. Objects will try to the two of
you, but you can protect yourself by hitting these objects. Additionally, you
can use the Reaction Command Whirlwind when inside a whirlwind to destroy most
of the on-screen objects. Also, Pooh will begin to free-fall if you're hit;
get near him and use the Reaction Command to rescue him. Do the same for
Piglet at the end.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>
TORN PAGES #2
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 ___________________
|  Items Checklist  \
|____________________\______________________________________________________
|  AP Boost ........................................................... []  |
|  Mythril Crystal .................................................... []  |
|  Draw Ring .......................................................... []  |
|___________________________________________________________________________|

This time, assuming this is the SECOND time you came, you'll find another area
popped up: Rabbit's House. Go there and you'll see Pooh floating in and down on
a balloon, landing on Eeyore's house (got insurance?). After thinking for a
bit, Sora and Piglet decide that feeding Pooh some honey may jog his memory.

Before deciding to do so, after the cutscene, look to the right. You'll find
two chests, in which you'll find an AP Boost and a Mythril Crystal. Go to the
left while facing the door to Rabbit's House to find a chest behind the
clothesline -- in it is the Draw Ring. Once ready, approach Eeyore. Pooh then
proceeds to eat lots, if not all, of Rabbit's Honey.

After the scene, you'll start a very cool minigame. It is, in essence, a race
to the finish line, with obstacles and honey in the way. The honey may wait
until next time you play, although you may as well get in some practice. By
hitting an obstacle, Pooh will fall off and lose 1 of his 10 HP (lose all ten
and you'll lose). To help you, pick up Gopher; he offers one-time protection.
To move, use the Analog Stick. Hold Square to move left/right faster. Press
Triangle to pick up Pooh or Gopher. Fairly simple. Just make it to the end and
you'll win.


In the scene after the minigame, Pooh will get stuck in the hole to Rabbit's
House, which he is soon tugged out of. The fall jogged his memory -- partially.
It seems that he still doesn't remember Sora.

After slapping in the third set of Torn Pages, Kanga and Roo's House will be
popped up. Go there. You'll also find Tigger there, too. Kanga will give you
some medicine that she things will make Pooh better, and then Tigger snatches
it. Before doing something, open the nearby chests (AP Boost, Magic Boost,
Orichalcum). When ready, talk to Tigger.

This starts the next minigame, Balloon Bounce. You'll simply jump up into the
air and get onto balloons, and higher and higher by using Reaction Commands.
You merely have to pop ten balloons in a single minute to finish this.

After slapping in the fourth set of Torn Pages, the new area that pops up will
be the Spooky Cave. Go there. There, you'll find that Pooh went into the cave
and got lost somewhere along the way. So, we have to find him.

Here's a map, credits to ElectroSpecter.

Anyway, the minigame goes like this. By using the map above, or your
navigational senses, you'll have to find Pooh (or the chests, THEN Pooh).
However, firstly, there is the Courage Gauge in the corner. As you go forward,
it will empty. When it is emptied, the party panicks and you'll have to use a
Reaction Command to calm them. If there is a hazard, like bees or falling
rocks, around, the gauge will empty faster. If you the ice twinkle or dust
fall from the ceiling, use a Reaction Command to stop everyone. In the case of
bees, smack them with the Keyblade. Once you reach Pooh, a cutscene should
ensue.

After it, you'll get the Sweet Memories Keyblade -- Sora's Lucky Lucky weapon
and the one that produces no stat gain -- and the Spooky Cave Map.

Once you arrive in the book and slap in the fifth and final Torn Pages, go to
the new popped-up area. When you get there, search around first for the Cosmic
Ring and the Style Recipe. After this, go up to the top of the hill and decide
to help Pooh.

In this minigame, the Hunny Pot, you'll want to throw the pot a long distance.
When the power gauge is close to full, press Triangle. Do it again to pop Pooh
out.

For succeeding, Pooh will remember you. After the scenes, you'll get a Cure
upgrade (to Curaga, I believe) and an Orichalcum+ (!!). Congrats, you have
beaten the 100 Acre Wood.

PART 1

 ___________________

|____________________\______________________________________________________
|  Undersea Kingdom Map ............................................... []  |
|___________________________________________________________________________|

When you land, it seems Sora forgot how to swim in his one-year nap, so you are
given an explanation. It is different from KH1, as you don't battle here. The
Right Analog Stick controls vertical/up-down movement while the Left Analog
Stick controls horizontal/left-right-forward-back movement. X will let you
swim faster, and pressing Circle while locked-on will take you to the target.
Begin by talking to Flounder. Sebastian will soon ask Sora to be in the concert
coming up soon. Sora accepts.

In the tutorial, you'll simply hit X when the blue circular bar is in the
orange and yellow areas (yellow is preferred). If you mess up the timing, it is
a BAD; orange is GOOD; yellow is EXCELLENT. After finishing the tutorial, you
will get the Undersea Kingdom Map.

When ready, talk to Sebastian to begin the musical. Don't try to hit START, or
you'll be forced to start over.

The musical is barely different from the tutorial. You'll get a music note at
the top of the screen for each EXCELLENT you get; GOODs do nothing and BADs
subtract a note. You'll have to have one note by the end to win.

Even after the musical, Ariel is still distracted with the world above, so
Flounder tells and shows Sora something he things she would like. However, it
is a (metal) statue buried under heavy wreckage.

      ~~~~~ To continue this world, return with the Magnet spell. ~~~~~


>>>>>>
PART 2
>>>>>>

Remember, for this visit, you need at least Magnet (or some variation thereof).
When you do have it, talk to Flounder and tell him that you want to move the
statue for Ariel. This puts you into another musical.

For this one, it is like the last one. You are still paying attention to the
gauge -- you want five or more EXCELLENTS in a row -- but you also have to
notice whether it is Triangle or X you're pressing. Remember, you must have
gotten five EXCELLENTS in a row to pass. If there are multiple prompts on the
screen, you'll get that many EXCELLENTS if you get EXCELLENT.

After this, Sebastian will show Sora a song which he cannot understand. So,
we're off.

       ~~~~~ You'll need a Drive Gauge of 5, 6, or 7 to continue. ~~~~~


>>>>>>
PART 3
>>>>>>

After finishing the second musical and returning here with a Drive Gauge at or
above level five, you can talk to Sebastian to do the third.

In this one, you'll find a new pink gauge -- it is triggered with the Square
button. It also has the timing thing, like the X and Triangle gauges, but your
performance depends on the character in the middle. If it is Ariel, DO press
Square. If it is Sebastian, do NOT press Sqaure. Also remember that the gauge
will indeed often change. To finish the musical, you'll need to get enough of
the gauges right to get Ariel in a good mood by the end, shown by the gauge.
Get it as high as possible by the end.

After this, you'll find Eric's pendant, wedged between some rocks. You'll need
to return with Magnera (and just Magnet could pull a statue from a shipwreck?).

    ~~~~~ To continue this world, come back with Magnera or Magnega. ~~~~~


>>>>>>
PART 4
>>>>>>
After giving Ariel the pendant, then talking to Sebastian, with some scenes in
between those events, you'll be ready for your fourth musical.

For this one, you'll find a new gauge. It is purple and, for it, you'll rapidly
press X. You'll also get some of the original X gauges, so be careful. As you
press X, you'll empty some of Ursula's HP. To win, have the gauge empty by the
end.

For winning, you'll get a Keyblade, the Mysterious Abyss.

         ~~~~~ To continue this world, come back with Thundaga. ~~~~~


>>>>>>
PART 5
>>>>>>

|___________________________________________________________________________|

After obtaining the spell Thundaga, return here and talk to Sebastian to begin
the fifth and final musical.

This musical has a mixture of all the gauges you've seen thus far, so I'll go
over them real quick:

-- X encircled by blue -> orange -> yellow gauge. For a better score, you'll
   want the gauge emptied into the yellow when you press X.
-- Triangle encircled by green -> orange -> yellow gauge. As with the previous,
   wait until the yellow to press TRIANGLE.
-- Ariel/Sebastian encircled by pink -> orange -> yellow gauge. Wait until the
   gauge is in the yellow for better scores. If the figure is Ariel, DO press
   Square. If not, DO NOT press Square.
-- X encircled by purplish gauge. This will get you lots of points. When this
   appears, repeatedly press X.

To complete this musical, you'll need a score of 30,000. It is easy enough.

For finishing Atlantica fully (which you now have done), you'll have a Blizzard
upgrade (to Blizzaga) and an Orichalcum+ (!!).

                      Section VI- Sephiroth     **KH56**
)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

After the 1,000 Heartless battle, you'll find Sephiroth in the Dark Depths,
which is past the Crystal Fissure and the Great Maw. Please listen to these
recommendations:

~~ Level: 65+
~~ Weapon: Ultima Weapon or Oblivion (if Sora's learned Berserk Charge)
           Fatal Crest (if Sora hasn't learned Berserk Charge)
~~ Armor: Cosmic Chain, Acrisius+, Acrisius+ (Defense +9, 60% F/T/B resistance)
          <OR> Ribbon (x3) (Defense +12, 48% all resistances)
          <OR> Cosmic Belt, Buster Band (x2) (Defense +16)
~~ Magic: Curaga, Reflega, Thundaga
~~ Items: 1 Ether, all else Elixirs/Megalixirs
~~ Abilities: Berserk Charge (or the Fatal Crest)
              Trinity Limit
              Guard
              High Jump Lv. 3
              Aerial Dodge Lv. 3
              Glide Lv. 3
              Once More
              Second Chance

The above list is all I require you have. If you feel that you want some more
abilities, go right ahead! Also, this method makes the boss ridiculously easy.
The whole purpose of the FAQ/Walkthrough was to make the game easier for you.
I understand if you want to use a method providing challenge. There are some
excellent Sephiroth FAQs on www.gamefaqs.com.

===============
BOSS: Sephiroth
===============

I will mention this: Sora fights alone!

Right from the start, repeatedly hit Triangle so as to Block Sephiroth's
initial attack; otherwise, kiss your butt good-bye.

I will not mention much of moves, because this method will usually finish
him before he gets much on you.

Firstly, immediately use Trinity Limit on him. After that, begin using the
Berserk command to start an ENDLESS COMBO upon Sephiroth, which almost
guarantees that, for this period of time, you'll never take a bit of damage.

After the MP gauge refills, either heal via Curaga or use Trinity Limit. If
you take too much damage before the refill, use an Elixir and go straight for
the Trinity Limit. DO NOT USE THE ETHER!

You'll probably see the vacuum-like fire pillar. Glide away from it.

You'll also probably hear Sephiroth say "Descend... Heartless... Angel". As
soon as you do, High Jump, Glide, and Aerial Dodge to him and whack him before
he hits you with the spell. Without Second Chance, you'll be KO'ed!! If you do
have it, you'll have 1 HP and no MP, so use the Elixir if it hits.

For the majority of the battle, alternate between Trinity Limits/Curagas and
Berserk Charges. Once Sephiroth gets down to one HP, use the Ether if your MP
gauge is still empty and then cast Thundaga until it hits. Thus, you have
beaten Sephiroth. Easier than KH1, eh?

For winning, Sora's Drive Gauge will increase by one full gauge.


After the battle, go to the Marketplace and tell Cloud about Sephiroth, then
return to the Dark Depths yourself. Approach Sephiroth for an awesome cutscene,
after which you'll get the Fenrir Keyblade, the Keyblade with the highest
Strength in the game. It has Negative Combo; if you equip this weapon and the
Negative Combo ability, all moves are finishing moves (if you also un-equipped
Air Combo/Combo Pluses). It also has pretty good range, and just plainly looks
cool. So, congrats for beating the toughest boss of KH2!

9. Summon Listings*****************************************KH9***************
Summons are those little things used by going to the Summon command in the
alternate menu when you get one. Each one costs 3 Drive Gauges (like Valor
and Wisdom Forms) and will take away Goofy and Donald. They, like the Forms,
have a time-based gauge that, when emptied, will make the Summon leave. This
gauge gets larger as the Summons level up. To level up, empty the Summon Gauge
bars. One emptied gauge = 1 EXP. A good trick is to pick up Drive Orbs just as
the gauge empties once. All Summons also have Limits, which deal damage and
empty the Summon Gauge faster, and can be Dismissed at will. As for other
attacks, they are based on the Summons themselves.

Firstly, here is a quick chart relating EXP., Summon level, and Summon Gauge.

O================O==============O================O
|  Summon Level  |  Experience  |  Summon Gauge  |
O================O==============O================O
|        1       |       0      |        3       |
|        2       |       6      |        4       |
|        3       |      22      |        5       | <- Get Genie to go past this
|        4       |      47      |        6       | <- Get Stitch to go past
|        5       |      89      |        7       | <- Get Peter Pan to go past
|        6       |     152      |        8       |
|        7       |     250      |        9       |
O----------------O--------------O----------------O

O------------------O
|  Chicken Little  |
O------------------O

To get Chicken Little, you'll need the Baseball Charm, which Merlin will give
to you during your first trip to Hollow Bastion. Upon being Summoned, his
whistle draws enemies close. He can Firecrackers and Balls to stun enemies,
and his Limit (FPS Mode) to control and stun enemies.


O---------O
|  Genie  |
O---------O

To use Genie, you'll need the Lamp Charm, which is gotten after beating Agrabah
for the first time. He can heal Sora, and also change his form based on a Drive
Form Sora has. Each of the four forms (Valor, Wisdom, Master, Final) have
different Limits, all of which are offensive.


O----------O
|  Stitch  |
O----------O

To use Stitch, you'll need the Ukelele Charm from Ansem's Study in Hollow
Bastion. Stitch causes enemies to drop HP orbs and restores Sora's MP. He can
also counterattack the enemies attempting to attack Sora. Stitch's Limit will
make Sora temporarily invulnerable to damage while Stitch attacks or plays the
ukelele to make enemies drop HP orbs.


O-------------O
|  Peter Pan  |
O-------------O

Peter Pan can only be used if you have the Feather Charm, found during your
second visit to Port Royal in the Ship Graveyard: The Interceptor's Hold.
Peter Pan can fly around, stabbing and damaging enemies. Also, like in KH1,
Tinker Bell will revive you if you get KO'ed, but this only works once per
Summon. The Limit will let you fly around and collect enemies until you feel
like unleashing pain upon them.

10. Drive Form Info******************************************KH10************
As soon as Sora got his new duds in Yen Sid's Tower, he also got Valor Form
and the Drive Gauge. The Drive Gauge is what determines whether you can use a
Drive Form, and which ones. The right Drive Form can really help in some
bosses, obviously. However, there is a sacrifice: Donald, Goofy, or both must
temporarily leave the battle.

When you use a Drive Form, the Drive Gauge becomes paler. This gauge will
continually empty. When it empties, you'll revert to your normal form. This
gauge will get larger as each form levels up.

Aside from the new abilities, power, and use of another Keyblade (in most
cases), if Sora levels up the Form enough, he himself will get new abilities!

O--------------O
|  Valor Form  |
O--------------O

Valor Form is obtained when Sora gets his new clothing in Yen Sid's Tower. At
the sacrifice of Goofy, Sora will become a super-fast attacker with two
Keyblades. This form can jump high, too, although it cannot use magic.

To level up this form, you'll need to hit enemies. A single hit yields one
EXP. The Land of Dragons, after the second visit, is a good place to level up,
although almost any will do.

O--------------O--------------O--------------O--------------------------------O


O---------------O
|  Wisdom Form  |
O---------------O

After completing Timeless River, you'll get Wisdom Form. This form sacrifices
Donald, and increases Sora's speed and Magic power. Sora's Keyblade becomes
long-range and pierces armor, like that of Large Bodies, and he can use magic
without stopping.

To level up this form, you'll have to defeat Heartless. One dead Heartless
(Nobodies don't count) equals 1 EXP. The Fragment Crossing of The World That
Never Was provides many weak Heartless, although grinding will be boring. If
you dislike boring, go to the four doors in Timeless River.

O---------------O
|  Master Form  |
O---------------O

Master Form is gotten after finding the Door to Darkness in Hollow Bastion
shortly before re-entering the Space Paranoids to save Tron. This form gives
a good balance of Strength and Magic, and, although with a bit too much flair,
is very good.

To level up this form, you'll need to collect Drive Orbs. The larger ones give
the most experience. Therefore, equip Jackpot(s) and the Wishing Lamp and go to
the Land of Dragons. The Assault Riders of the Palace Gates and the Antechamber
seem to do best.

O--------------O
|  Final Form  |
O--------------O

After the cool cutscene when traveling to the Memory's Skyscraper in The World
That Never Was (no, I will not spoil this one!), you can randomly transform 
into Final Form when you use Valor, Wisdom, or Master Form (it doesn't matter
which). This form is the best, because of power, looks, and the Form Boost
and Glide abilities. It does sacrifice both Donald and Goofy.

Another AWESOME thing about this is that, with continual use, you'll never get
the dreaded dark Sora (technically, it's Anti Form) ever again!!

To level up this form, you'll never to kill Nobodies. Each Nobody kill equals
one EXP. The Naught's Skyway is best, because of the many weak Creepers.

O--------------O--------------O--------------O--------------------------------O


O-------------O
|  Anti Form  |
O-------------O

The dreaded form of darkness. This form occurs occasionally and will sacrifice
both Donald and Goofy. As you use your forms, your Anti-Points (an invisible
stat) will build up to such a point that, upon your next transformation, you
will become Anti-Sora.

This form is weak. It does have super-fast (but WEAK) attacks and some weird
command with Square. You cannot end the form manually, use items or magic, or
Reaction Commands. Attacking will bring down the gauge faster; when it is
emptied, you'll revert to normal Sora with a completely-empty Drive Gauge
(regardless of what you had prior to transformation).

Anti Form occurs often in bosses, and even more often when fighting members of
Organization XIII. However, if you continually use Final Form, you'll never
worry about this again, as it DECREASES Anti-Points.

Additionally, this form gains no EXP., levels, or abilities.

11. Synthesis Guide**************************************KH11****************

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
INTRODUCTION TO SYNTHESIS
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

As with most RPGs that include a synthesis thing (KH1, KH2) or an invention
thing (MegaMan Legends, Dark Cloud 2), it is quite considerably the longest
and most daunting task to document AND do. However, it yields considerably
equal rewards.

When you first find the Synthesis Shop in Hollow Bastion (although it is also
usable from the holograms), you can do very little except drop off materials.
You'll be able to use Free Development and Creations after turning in five
different kinds of materials; and you use Recipes after the Moogle reaches
level one.

Once you reach both points, you'll get a menu like this:

Creations
Free Development
Recipes
Materials
Material Log
Lists
Quit

CREATIONS is initially empty. It is only filled when you make an item. This is
also where you make the "Serenity" form of items, as I call them.

FREE DEVELOPMENT is just some basic synths. You'll have this upgraded when you
turn in twenty different materials.

RECIPES is filled up as you turn in Recipes that you'll find from chests.

MATERIALS shows what materials the Moogle has in all from you.

MATERIAL LOG keeps track of all materials turned in in the past.

LISTS keeps track of the special requirements you've met in the synthesis
sidequesting thing.

QUIT exits the menu.

chances, something I never would've gotten by myself. Thanks, guys.
