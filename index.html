If you are reading this Jessica (Marios-Friend9), you made a wonderful and beautiful game.
Your artwork and whoever made this game possible are amazing. Keep up the good work and I 
hope you finish ARC soon and make more games after that! :)

As you know now, (Mario) The Music Box is getting taken down from acouple of sites.
I wish I could post a download link to the game. But I will not. I don't also want this
walkthrough to be taken down as well. WHY NINTENDO, WHY?!?!?!?!

You can download the gallery photos of (Mario) The Music Box if you want. They are pretty amazing to look at: <a href="Downloads/_mario_the_music_box__full_cg_download_by_marios_friend9-d9exhh7.zip" download>CLICK HERE!</a>
