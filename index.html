// 1. INFORMATION ABOUT THE GUIDE
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</B>
THIS WILL BE A SPOILER-FREE GUIDE. ANYTHING THAT I THOUGHT WAS BEING SPOILED IS REPLACE BY "-REDACTED-". 
I'll try not to spoil things for the player so I won't talk much of what the cutscenes are.
I want you to experience the fear and joy of the game. 

I made this guide becasue I enjoyed the game very much. I definitely plan on making a guide when ARC gets done. 
I might also plan on making a guide on her future games.

Also note that the room names I used aren't the names used in the game. I used it to my
comfort. So you can call them whatever you want. These names just help me to remember them
easierly.
<B id="info2">
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 2. INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</B>
Ok, I just want to make things clear about this game. This game is choice driven which
means that the choices you do will effect the outcome on the ending. Also, the choices that
you do can also make you get a gameover. So if you don't a gameover or you want to know 
how to get everything in this game, this will be the best guide (hopefully). This game also 
has many things to interact with and you can freely do so but almost everything you 
interact with is pointless. Hear me out, I love to interact to everything, don't hate me 
when I say it's pointless. My first playtrhough, I interacted to everything in the game 
and I had a ton of fun. But if you want a 100% in the game, there are only a couple of 
things that you (must)/can freely interact with. For instance, the liabrary room has a 
bookcase to interact with that you can completely ignore but if you do ignore it, you 
won't get 100% in this game. There are some things that you can interact with that you can 
get more story information on but won't effect the ending of the game. If you want to 
interact with everything, go ahead! :)

3. THE GAME INTRODUCTION
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<U id="videointro">
- VIDEO INTRODUCTION -</B></U>

<video id="video" width="640" height="480">
<source src="Video/(Mario) The Music Box in-game Intro (Warning Flashing Lights).mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<button onclick="playVid()" type="button">Play Video</button><button onclick="pauseVid()" type="button">Pause Video</button> <button onclick="skip(-10)" type="button"><<</button><button onclick="restart()" type="button">Restart Video</button><button onclick="skip(10)" type="button">>></button> <button onclick="dark()" type="button">Dark</button><button onclick="light()" type="button">Light</button>

<B><U>- THE GARDEN -</U></B>

The game starts off with you choosing the text sound enable/disable and also the choice of 
watching the intro or not. After you do those choices then your horror adventure begins.

After those choices the game starts off with Mario getting lost. He then gets his map out
and now knows where he is going. You the player will then get control when Mario gets to the
Garden. The Player will get a Journal Entry.

This is the introduction part of the game. It will teach you the gaming machanics. Almost 
everything in the Garden is interactable. Enjoy it while it last cause after you leave the
Garden, some of the stuff you interact with can kill you causing a gameover.

To leave the Garden, you must go to the fountain that is in the middle of the Garden. A 
message will then pop up which will say, "Curosity Killed The Cat". This just tells you that
choice that you make can kill you. After reading that message, you the player will get an
option to choose between yes or no. Pick yes and you'll get a rusty crowbar.

Now go to the door and cutscene will appear (depending if you didn't go to the door first 
before picking up the rusty crowbar). After that cutscene, you can interact with the door.
A button scene will appear (depending on the version you have, you will either press any
keys on the keyboad or just the spacebar. Most lastest versions will make you just press
the spacebar. This was due because players thought it was too hard with pressing any keys.
e personally, I thought it was fun.). After that scene is over, you will then get inside
the house.

<B><U>- MAIN LOBBY -</U></B>

Once you enter the house, Mario will talk about how dark the main lobby is. He will also 
talk about seeing a light from a room upstairs. You can interact everything but it won't
do much since its dark. You must go to the room upstairs. Go straight to the stairs, 
take a left and you'll see a door with an arrow above it (indicating that is where you 
must go). Enter the room.

<B><U>- THE MUSIC BOX HALLWAY -</U></B>

Once you enter that room, you'll hear music. Mario will talk again. Once hes
done talking, continue going left and enter that room. 

<B><U>- THE MUSIC BOX ROOM -</U></B>

The room is completely lit and there is a music box on the table in the middle of 
room. Interacct with it. You'll pick it up and also pick up a map under it. Then, 
the room gets dark for unknown reason and Mario will get hit. When Mario gets up, 
he'll see that there is a latern next to him. He automatically picks it up and 
uses it. Now you the player has light. If you want, you can interact with everything 
in the room. Nothing will kill you. Once your're done with that, you can leave the room.

<B><U>- BACK TO THE MUSIC BOX HALLWAY -</U></B>

Continuing through the hallway you'll see blood on the wall. You can choose to interact 
with it, it'll say, "TAKE THE EXIT" (indicating you to leave the house).
Once you have read that or not, leave the hallway.

<B><U>- BACK TO THE MAIN LOBBY -</U></B>

Once your in the main lobby, again you can choose to interact with the envirment you're in 
but I would wait and just go to the entrance of the house first. Continue going right, down 
the stairs and to the door. But once you interact with the door, you the player will see
that there is no door. Now the horror adventure truely begins.

// 4. THE HORROR TRUELY BEGINS (MARIO)
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</span>
<U>- MAIN LOBBY -</U></B>

Mario will freak out, trying to calm himself and tell himself that this is just a prank. 
Once his panic attack stops and you get control over Mario, you can almost freely go 
anywhere. You can go to the right and left hallway of the firt floor and the bathroom in 
the first floor (right door). You can also interact with the evironment now, just be 
careful. If you interact with the door upstairs from the middle, you will die. If you 
interact with the crack upstairs from the bedroom door (the right door), you will die. Its 
your choice.

<U><B>- THE BATHROOM -</U></B>

This is if you choose the right door from the first floor. This is gonna be very quick, Be 
wary what you do here though. You can die twice here. Once you walked through the little 
hallway in the room, you'll be in the bathroom. There is a blood on the floor to the left 
of you (looking away from the hallway below you). DO NOT INTERACT WITH THAT BLOOD SPOT, 
YOU WILL DIE! Instead go to the shelf beside from the right of the sink. Interact with it 
and you'll get a music sheet (this will be used later). Becareful now, once you take a 
couple of steps a monster will appear and chase you. GO BACK TO THE DOOR YOU CAME FROM AS 
FAST AS POSSIBLE. Once you're at the door, you'll be dealt with an action scene. If you 
complete the action scene successfully, you'll exit the room. The door will be locked 
from now on.

<U><B>- THE LIVING ROOM HALLWAY -</U></B>

This is if you chose the right hallway of the first floor. When you enter this room. You
will see a shadowy person going into the darkness. Mario get curious who it is, thinking it 
might be the princess. There is a door in the middle of the hallway, you can choose to
enter it but there is nothing to do in there. That will be for later, towards the end of
game. Just continue to the right and you'll be in the living room.

<U><B>- THE FOREST HALLWAY -</U></B>

If you decided just to explore around here, no biggie. There is a door ahead, you can 
decide if you want to go there or not.

<U><B>- THE FOREST ENTRANCE -</U></B>

Ok, there is nothing to do here, this route is here for later in the game. If you go up to
water, it'll let you decide if you want to swim across or do nothing. DON'T SELECT SWIM
ACROSS BECAUSE YOU WILL DIE. Just turn back to the living room hallway.

<U><B>- THE LIVING ROOM -</U></B>

There is a lot of things to interact with this room. Be wary though, there is a spot where 
you'll die if you interact. There is a door literally right above you. You can choose to 
enter there. If you enter there, there is a doll that you can get. The dool in on the 
shelf, the farthest left corner of the room. As of right now, I don't belive the doll has 
anything important to the story; I think its just use to have fun. If you go to you're 
inventory and go to key items, if you choose the doll. It'll interact with the music box.
Nothing special, just some sweet music though.

If you choose not to go or you decided to leave the room, there is a bookcase beside the door. 
Interact with it and you'll get a photo and a Journal Entry (YOU MUST GET THIS JOURNAL ENTRY 
TO OPEN THE SCISSOR GIRL'S ROOM). Now continue going right, you'll be in a little mini hallway. 
There is a book you can interact with at the right corner of the end of the hallway, it does 
nothing but give you the chills. There is a door by the leftside of the book. If you decide to 
go in there be careful. (If you went inside the room, skip to THE SCISSOR GIRL ROOM section 
then go to THE PIANO GIRL section when you're done)

<U><B>- THE PIANO GIRL -</U></B>

Go to the left, and there will be a little room with a fireplace and a piano. Interact with 
the piano (This is only possible if you have the first music sheet that was in the 
bathroom) and Mario will play music. Once that is over, a spirit will appear and ask you to 
find the other missing piece of the music sheet. After done talking to her, you'll get a Journal 
Entry. Remember that door by the book (in this room)? Go the door by the book if you haven't yet. 

<U><B>- THE SCISSOR GIRL ROOM -</U></B>

BEFORE YOU ENTER THIS ROOM, MAKE SURE YOU SAVE IT.

Once you enter this room the first time, you'll be dealt with an action scene. There is a 
girl in there with scissors trying to kill you. If you sucessfully pulled off the action 
scene, it'll make you leave the room. Upon so, you'll get a Journal Entry but go back in the 
room because the music sheet is in there. Once you go back in the room, walk a little ahead 
and you'll see a chest. You can decide to open it but it'll give you scissors which I believe 
that has no use to you. Anyways, go to the end of the room and you'll see a shelf that you 
can interact with. Interact with it and you'll get a music sheet. Now leave the room.

<U><B>- BACK TO THE PIANO GIRL -</U></B>

Once you collected both of the music sheets, give the music sheets to the piano girl will 
give you a key to the library which is located in the left door of the second floor of 
the main lobby.

If you haven't got any of the music sheets; one is at the bathroom, the other is at the 
Scissor Girl's room.

<U><B>- THE LIBRARY -</U></B>

Once you got your way here, there will be a lamp right beside you from the left. You can 
choose to turn it on. Its entirely up to you if you want but it'll lit up the room if you 
decide to turn in on. There is a couple of things you can interact here. There is one thing 
in this room that you must interact if you want 100%. There is a bookshelf from the third 
row farthest from you. You must interact with the third shelf closest to the right of the 
room. It'll give you a journal entry if you read "The Missing People". If you decide not or
did read it, go to the little table that has a book on it from the left side of the room.
It'll have a picture of Mario with a bunch of words that say, "kill" around the picture.
You'll get a key to the Kitchen and another Journal Entry. You can choose to stay here and 
read more books or can leave and continue on your horror adventure.

<U><B>- THE BEDROOM HALLWAY -</U></B>

Once you enter here, walking a couple of steps; you'll see a door. If you want 100%, you 
must enter that room before continueing on. If you decided not to go or have done this, 
continue left of the hallway and enter the next room. Hey wait a second you might say, 
what about that check next to the door on the middle of the hallway. Well, you can't open 
it till you get a chest key but that is in the next room. So go to the next room.

<U><B>- ENDLESS HALLWAY -</U></B>

If you decided that you want to have a 100%, you have not continued and entered this room 
instead. This room is endless, all you have to do is go through it once and you'll get a
journal entry. You can leave after that is done. I'LL REPEAT IT THOUGH, YOU HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THE HALLWAY ONCE TO GET 100% IN THE GAME. You can leave now and go on with your
adventure.

<U><B>- THE BEDROOM HALLWAY #2 -</U></B>

There will be a door to your right (walking from the hallway). You can't enter there yet.
instead continue walking in the hallway, you'll see a plant knocked over. Go to it and 
interact with it and you'll get a chest key. You can continue through the hallway. Once 
you're at the end of the hallway, a life or death scene will appear. Mario will hear a
monster/spirit and he'll hide in the create. A message will appear and it'll give you two 
choices. If you want to leave, make sure that YOU STAY IN THE CREATE. If you want to die,
YOU TAKE A PEAK but have fun with that. Once the monster is gone, continue through the 
hallway. You'll enter the graveyard.

<U><B>- THE GRAVEYARD -</U></B>

There isn't much to do here yet other than death choices. lol. So just go back.

<U><B>- BACK TO THE BEDROOM HALLWAY -</U></B>

Go to the chest and open it by interacting with it. You'll get a note and a Journal Entry. 
This note will be used for the safe in the kitchen.

<U><B>- BACK TO THE MAIN LOBBY -</U></B>

Go to the kitchen which is located in the left door from the first floor.

<U><B>- THE KITCHEN -</U></B>

Once you have entered this room, you can interact with everything if you want to. If you 
plan to do so, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T INTERACT WITH THE DOOR AT THE MIDDLE END OF THE ROOM.
You will die. If you haven't look at the note yet, go do it now. You'll get the code to 
the safe. Once you do so, go to the safe which is at the top left corner at the room. 
The code isn't what is said on the note but how they are alphetbetically numbered. 
For instance, A is 1, B is 2, C is 3, and so on.

NOTE: You can't open the safe without knowing the code. So you better get that code, lol.

The code to the safe is:

H(8)
O(15)
P(16)
E(5)
L(12)
E(5)
S(19)
S(19)

Once you enter that code, you'll get the Master Bed Room Key which is located on the door 
to the right at the Second floor from the Main Lobby.

<U><B>- THE MASTER BEDROOM -</U></B>

The Master Bedroom is pretty simple puzzle. Once you entered here, there will be a door right 
infront of you but it is locked. To unlock you, you would have to go to the attic of the room. 
There are stairs at the bottom left corner of the room.

<U><B>- THE ATTIC -</U></B>

Ok, here where the puzzle is. I'll tell you what to do:

1. Push the first pot you see down.
2. Go right and push the second pot right.
3. Go down and push third pot down.
4. Go right and push fouth pot all the way to the right.
5. Go up and push the fifth pot just up one time and then push sixth pot beside it right all the way.
6. Go up then left and push the seventh pot to the left one time then push the last pot beside to the right all the way.
7. You finish the puzzle, now leave the attic.

<U><B>- BACK AT THE MASTER BED ROOM -</U></B>

Once you made it down the stairs, you should be back at the Master Bedroom. You can choose 
to unlock that door that was locked in the front. Anywho, there is a bookcase to interact 
with. But once you do, a cutscene will appear and you'll lose the ability to control Mario. 
Before you do so, I would save and if you want you could explore around the house if you 
want. Now, at this point you should have eight journal entries. If you don't, you better go 
back and reread my walkthrough.

The journal entries that you should have at this point are:

1. Made it to home
2. Couple in the photo
3. Someone wants me dead
4. Girl with Scissors
5. An Investigation
6. Aria
7. Endless Hall
8. Hopeless

IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF THESE MAKE SURE YOU DO, YOU'LL ONLY GET 100% (TRUE ENDING) IF YOU
HAVE ALL THE JOURNAL ENTRIES!!! If you don't want to get 100% then you can just go on 
ahead. :)

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</span>
<U>- NOTE ABOUT LUIGI -</B></U>

Even though its hella fun playing as Luigi (Luigi is my man!), there isn't really much to do as him. You can't collect
any Journal Entries because he doesn't have a journal. (If you are reading this Jessica, you definely should make 
Luigi have a journal, it would be pretty cool!) There is only a couple of death spots playing as him. I'm not trying 
to rain on your parade but just forwarning you that don't expect much. Now onward to awesomeness cause Luigi is gonna
save the day! :)

<B><U>- LOOKING FOR YOUR LOST BROTHER (MAIN LOBBY) -</B></U>

Ok, I'm gonna start to say that most of the rooms are locked when you play as Luigi. Since I believe the reason is
cause Luigi isn't far enough into the mansion at first. He just got there and later he'll encounter problems. 
Anyways, before I get to ahead of myself. Lets find your brother! So, you must go to the second floor of the main
lobby. Once you're there, you can go to the right hallway now (before you could't go as Mario because the spirits
didn't watn him to).

<B><U>- THE BALLROOM HALLWAY -</B></U>

Ok, beware of this hallway. A little along the way you'll see a door in the middle of the hallway. DO NOT GO IN THERE!
Luigi will imediately die if he opens that door. Just avoid it unless you're just here to see all the deaths in the 
game, lol. Just continue right and go to the next room.

<B><U>- IS THAT MARIO? (RESTING ROOM) -</B></U>

Once you you're in the room, you'll be greeted with a cutscene. You'll be chased by a misterious Mario figure that 
came out of a painting. Once the cutscene is over you'll imediately get an action scene. Once you complete that, try
to go to the door to the left of you. That is the only door that can be open. If you were lucky enough to get to that
door fast or you outsmarted the "Mario" by running around the room. The door has a code:

STAR + TRIANGLE = ?

Some people might get this, others not so likely. I'll give you a tip, get it? If you didn't figure out what I just 
told you there. You count the tips of the figures:

STAR(5) + TRIANGLE(3) = STARANGLE(8)

The door will open and Luigi will automatically go to the next room.

<B><U>- WAIT! THAT CAN'T BE MARIO! (BEDROOM) -</B></U>

Another cutscene will appear, after that cutscene is over you'll get to be in control again. Mario is resting in the
bed next you but theres nothing you can do much for him. So you should leave the room and see whats going on.

<B><U>- THE RESTING ROOM -</B></U>

Ok, the "Mario" that was chasing you is gone. Go to the room the far bottom right of you. There is a item to get in
there.

<B><U>- THE CHEST ROOM -</B></U>

Once you're in this room, just walk down a bit and you'll see a chest surrounded by blood. Opening it but it won't let
you first. Try it a second time and a cutscene will appear. After the cutscene is over, you'll get the storage key.
Leave the room and go to the far bottom left door of the resting room.

<B><U>- THE STORAGE ROOM -</B></U>

Ok, this room is a bit creepy isn't it. This room has a couple of cutscenes and a action scene. Go down and you'll 
be treated with an cutscene. after that cutscene is over, go left and go in that room. There is a key and a map to 
collect from one of the shelves from the right corner of the room. Once you pick up the bathroom key and the map, 
you can now leave the room. But beware, along the way you'll be treated with an action scene.

<B><U>- BACK AT THE RESTING ROOM -</B></U>

After that action scene you'll be automatically here. Now just go to the room next to you from the right. That is the
bathroom.

<B><U>- WHAT IS GOING ON WITH LUIGI'S HEAD! (THE BATHROOM) -</B></U>

Once you're in the bathroom. You see a dead body on floor, go to it. You'll be treated with a cutscene. After the
cutscene you'll automatically leave the room.

<B><U>- IS THAT MARIO AGAIN?! (RESTING ROOM) -</B></U>

You'll see a Mario figure walking to the stairs in the room (stairs is located from the top right corner of the room).
Follow him and go to the stairs. Once you make it up the stairs, you'll be in another room with another set of stairs.
Go up the stairs again to the left of you.

<B><U>- THERES A THIRD FLOOR? (RIGHT ROOFTOP HALLWAY) -</B></U>

You'll be in a hallway room. There is a bookcase directly infront of you that you can move. You move it to the left.
Once you do that, there is a hole. Interact with the hole and you'll get a drawling. Go into you're inventory and look
at the drawling. There is a code on the back of the drawling:

12A6

There is a door to the left of you but it is locked from the other side. You must go right and go up the stairs. (You
can freely look around if you want to before you go upstairs)

<B><U>- WHY MARIO?!?! (THE ROOFTOP) -</B></U>

Once you got up the stairs, you'll be at the rooftop. A cutscene will play. After the cutscene, you'll gain control 
again. Walk up a bit and go left. You'll see stairs going down. Go down those stairs.

<B><U>- LEFT ROOFTOP HALLWAY -</B></U>

Ok, if I were you. I would go imediately right to the door. You want to unlock the door that was locked first for 
easier acess.

<B><U>- MIDDLE ROOFTOP HALLWAY -</B></U>

Nothing much to do here, can't open any doors other the door that connects to the other hallway. Unlock that door and
go back the the hallway you were previously in.

<B><U>- LEFT ROOFTOP HALLWAY AGAIN -</B></U>

once you're back here, go to the door to the top right. The door to the left is broken, it can't be open. So go to
the door to the top right.

<B><U>- THE BUTLER'S ROOM -</B></U>

Ok, another creepy place. OMG, so many creepy places! Anyways, Luigi ain't scared of no ghost! lol. There is a cabnet
in front of you that can open. It will need a code, do you remember it? It was that code that was on the back of the
drawling you got. If you didn't get that drawling, make sure you get it because if you don't open this cabnet and get
the item that is in it. YOU WILL DIE IN THE NEXT ROOM! So once you input the code you'll get an old photo. This will
be very important to get cause without it, you can't continue. Go to the door from the left of you and go in that
room. (You can freely interact here if you want)

<B><U>- THE BUTLER'S BATHROOM -</B></U>

Ok, by far this is really creepy. The butler is waiting for you. Go talk to him. You give him the photo and he'll tell
you -REDACTED- and leave you. He drops a key for you to pick up. Once you gain control, pick up the key. You got the
Darwling Room key. Leave the bathroom and the Butler's room.

<B><U>- WHO ARE YOU? (LEFT ROOFTOP HALLWAY) -</B></U>

Once you enter back the hallway, a cutscene will tigger. You'll meet a person named Riba (he's also investigating the 
house). He tell you -REDACTED- . He leaves you and wishes goodluck finding your brotehr. Once the cutscene is over,
you want to go to the drawling room which is located on the second floor. To go there, you must go the door at the 
bottom of the hallway.

<B><U>- A GIRL?! (DRAWLING HALLWAY) -</B></U>

Once you get in this room, you'll see a girl walk across the room (spooky isn't it?). After she disappears, you'll have 
control again. Theres an item on top of the bookcase (located between the two doors). You're wondering how you can get 
this item? Well, there is a stoll across the room. You must push it across the room to the bookshelf. Once you do that, 
interact with the stoll and you'll get a screwdriver. This will be useful later. Now, there isn't much to go to. The 
door is locked from the left of you and the door at the bottom is blocked. Go to the door to the right of you. A cutscene 
will appear. After that you can go in.

<B><U>- THE DRAWLING ROOM -</B></U>

OMG! There's that "Mario" again! But don't worry. He won't do anything to you in a bit. Ok, this room is kind of've
like a puzzle. There is a book to the left of you, go to it. Interact with it and it'll say, ".....There's a secret I
left in this room.~" This just tells you that there is something to interact with that will open a secret door. So
guess what you're going to do? Search around everywhere and interact with it. Ain't that fun? Well, if you can't
figure it out yet, don't worry! I tell you how to find the secret. FIRST THOUGH, YOU MUST GET THAT SCREWDRIVER!
Without it, you can't find the secret. The secret is on the clock on the top right corner of the room. Interact with
it and it'll open a secret door at the bottom left corner of the room. Go to it and you'll see stairs. Go down the
stairs.

<B><U>- POOR LUIGI -</B></U>

Once you go down the stairs, you'll get pushed by the "Mario" that was in the room earlier with you. You fell down the
stairs and get knocked out. You get up and -REDACT- (go to it and interact with it and a cutscene plays)

// 6. WEIRD DREAMS (MARIO/RIBA)
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</span>
<U>- VOID (MARIO) -</B></U>

A Luigi's cutscene will end and you will be playing as Mario. He's in a void, a dream. But why? If you walk a bit, 
you'll see a woman standing there. Interact with her and she'll say -REDACTED-. You'll then be transported to another
room. Just keep going right and you'll see a girl sitting down. Interact with her and a cutscene plays.

<B><U>- WAKING UP (BEDROOM) [MARIO] -</B></U>

A cutscene will play; Mario wakes up hearing a voice, it's Riba from Luigi's playthrough. But why is he here? He talks
and Mario talks. After the cutscene is over, you'll get a Journal Entry. Go to the blue table next to the bed. Interact 
with it and you'll get anotehr Journal Entry. Now, there is a door to the left of you. Go to it.

<B><U>- HEY, HOW DID WE GET HERE? (BEDROOM HALLWAY #2) [MARIO] -</B></U>

Notice where we are? If you do, you have a prety good memory. This is the hallway to the outside but we needed a
bridge or something to get across. Since Riba is in your party, I believe that getting across that gap is possible. Go
outside. (You can't go to the other rooms cause Riba won't let you)

<B><U>- THESES CHOICES (GRAVEYARD) [MARIO] -</B></U>

Interact with the cliff and (cutscene) you'll talk to Riba and some options will appear, choose wisely! These choices can 
be quite diffitcult to choose. Some of the choices may seem to be right but they're not.

The correct choices are:

1. Let him go alone
2. Keep it

Once you do those choices, you'll be playing as Riba.

<B><U>- OMG RUN!!! (BEDROOM HALLWAY #2) [RIBA] -</B></U>

AS SOON AS YOU PLAY AS RIBA TURN BACK AND GO OUTSIDE AGAIN. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE!!!! There is a evil spirit in the
hallway. You get touch by her, it's a gameover. Now then, let's run like hell. lol. Once you go back into the
hallway, run along the left side of the room. The monster spawns close the rightside of the walls (almost where the 
bedroom is at). RUN, RUN, RUN to the other hallway. After you're in that room, you're safe!

<B><U>- WOAH, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE (BEDROOM HALLWAY) [RIBA] -</B></U>

Once you are here, you should save again. There are more dangers ahead. You can't go to the main lobby. Riba won't let
you. Remember that endless hallway. Try going in there.

<B><U>- THIS ISN'T ENDLESS (NURSERY HALLWAY) [RIBA] -</B></U>

Just continue ahead and go to the next room. Oh look at that, it isn't endless for some reason. IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER
THIS BEING ENDLESS, YOU MUST HAVE NOT GONE INTO THE HALLWAY BEFORE WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T GET THE TRUE ENDING! Sorry,
you'll have to start over if you want the true ending.

<B><U>- SO DARK (NURSERY) [RIBA] -</B></U>

Ok, there isn't much to do in this room. Just go to the top left corner of the room, there is a door there. Go in it.

<B><U>- FOUND IT! (DOLL ROOM) [RIBA] -</B></U>

This by far is the creepiest room I seen. Man, why does it have to be dolls. Anyways, There are planks at the top left
corner of the room. Interact with it. You'll get a plank and also some matches to see and someth.... OMG! THERES AN
EVIL SPIRIT WITH YOU IN THE ROOM. There is going to be an dialoge scene. Life or death choice. To live chose, "Dodge 
it's attack then run". If you chose the other, you will die. Once that done, you'll be at the nursery room again.

<B><U>- TIME TO GO BACK FOR MARIO (NURSERY ROOM) [RIBA] -</B></U>

Now it's time to go back to Mario, just leave the room.

<B><U>- MARIO??? (NURSERY HALLWAY) [RIBA] -</B></U>

Just coninue along the way and go to the door. A cutscene will appear and Mario's here but he looks a little strange.
He looks like he -REDACTED-. RUN AWAY FROM MARIO OR HE'LL KILL YOU! The game will let you save. You can't outsmart him, 
he'll kill you so you're best choice is to go back.

<B><U>- GOTTA HIDE! (NURSERY ROOM) [RIBA] -</B></U>

ONCE YOU ENTER THIS ROOM, TURN AROUND AND INTERACT WITH THE DOOR TO LOCK IT. IF YOU DIDN'T, YOU WILL DIE! Ok, now you
got to find a hiding spot. You only have 30 seconds to hide. There are multiple hiding spots, a secret and funny one is 
the lamp by the fireplace. In my first playthrough I picked that spot cause I was trying to be the best hide-n-seek player, 
lol. Anyways, pick the closet next to the doll room door.

Once you chose the closet and cutscene will play then Dialoge will appear, choose "Jump out". If you choose the other,
you will die. Once you jump out, you'll be at a action scene. Do the action scene twice but not a third time. If you 
do it a third time, it'll be a gameover. After that action scene you'll be at another cutscene.

<B><U>- BACK AT THE VOID [MARIO] -</B></U>

Mario will wake up and he'll see a woman walking across. Follow her. A little along the way there will be a door that
has light coming out from it. Enter it, a cutscene will play.

<B><U>- THE LIES (NURSERY ROOM) [MARIO] -</B></U>

Another cutscene will play, Mario will wake up and is then talking to Riba. Mario will relize he had a -REDACTED-.
You will have to lie to Mario to be alive/get the good ending(kinda, the ending you get when you lie to him isn't
really a ending, its more of a gameover). These are the correct answers:

1. Lie
2. Don't tell him

Pretty simple, lol. Now, you can leave and go to the graveyard.

<B><U>- THE GRAVEYARD AGAIN -</B></U>

Interact with the chilf agian, a cutscene will appear. Apparently Riba forgot the planks. Oh boy... Anyways, he goes
alone again to get the planks and you made it safely across.

<B><U>- THE GRAVEYARD #2 -</B></U>

Just continue on, nothing to see. lol.

<B><U>- GRAVEYARD #3 -</B></U>

After walking acoupe of steps up the stone stairs, Mario will pass out and you'll play as Riba for a bit. The reason
due to mario passing out is because he is hungry. I would be hungry too, being scared so much will probably make any
person hungry. Anyways, the food is up the stairs to you're right.

<B><U>- GRAVEYARD #4 -</B></U>

Be warned, don't talk to any of the spirits along the way. Riba will die if you do. Once you made it up the stairs, 
you'll see a second set of stairs, go up and you'll see a log. Don't go left across the bridge (you can't even cross 
it anyways yet). There are mushrooms at the left side of the log. MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE RED MUSHROOM, DON'T PICK THE 
PURPLE MUSHROOM DUE TO OBVISOUS REASONS! IF YOU PICK UP THE PURPLE ONE, YOU WILL KILL MARIO. Go back down the stairs 
and go down the other set of staris to Mario.

<B><U>- BACK TO GRAVEYARD #3 -</B></U>

Give Mario the mushroom. Mario will thank Riba and will be playable after that. Go up the stairs again.

<B><U>- BACK TO GRAVEYARD #4 -</B></U>

Don't cross the bridge yet. Go up to the log (up the second set of stairs) and interact with that spirit sitting down 
on the log. You will get a Journal Entry. Trust me, MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS CAUSE I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE HER IN MY FIRST 
PLAYTHROUGH. lol. I got very upset cause I was missing one Journal Entry when I beat the game. Anyone, now go down the 
stairs and cross the bridge.

<B><U>- GRAVEYARD #5 -</B></U>

A cutscene will play, you'll start moving slow and hearing voices. Just get across the bridge and go up those stairs.
You can interact with the spirit if you want to but she just disappears. You do want to interact with that letter on
the ground. Once you do a cutscene will play. You'll start reading the letter, it says -REDACTED-. Riba comes and 
-REDACTED-. Mario gets knocked out.

<B><U>- BACK TO THE VOID ONCE AGAIN -</B></U>

NOTE: DO NOT GO IN ANY OF THE DOORS THAT DON'T HAVE LIGHT. IF YOU GO INTO ANY OF THE DOORS THAT DON'T YOU WILL DIE!

Once again, you're back here. Just continue walking right and go into that door with the light, a cutscene will play.

<B><U>- THE SEARCH FOR LUIGI -</B></U>

A cutscene will play, Mario will wake up at a room you'll never explored in. This time, no Riba. Now, you must go 
find your brother Luigi. You'll get a journal entry. All the doors a locked , there is stairs at the right of you 
at the top right corner of the room. Go up the stairs.

<U>- Up THE STAIRS -</B></U>

Ok, prepare for the worst. lol It's a pretty good ending to watch. I think all the endings in this game are amazing to
watch but let's go up the stairs to the right of you. A cutscene will playing, making sure that this dicision is final.

<B><U>- DEECIDING TO GO TO THE RIGHT (MIDDLE ROOFTOP HALLWAY) -</B></U>

Nothing much happens here other then words surrounding you head, saying -REDACTED-. You can't open any doors, might as
well go back and interact with that door...

<B><U>- ARE YOU OK MARIO? (LEFT ROOFTOP HALLWAY) -</U></B>

Another cutscene will play. Once you gain control, walk forward a bit. Go to the door with the bloodspot by it. Interact with
the door. You'll get dialodge options. DON'T GO IN THE DOOR, YOU'LL GET LUIGI KILLED! Just select no for every choice.
Mario will then -REDACTED-. Luigi will put Mario on the couch. Interact with him once you gain control again. A
cutscene will play. Once that cutscene is over, you can now go to the door nect to you without any problems...

<B><U>- ROSA THE MAID (THE BUTLER'S ROOM) -</B></U>

Go talk to the woman that is on the ground, her name is Rosa. One of the maid servents in the house. She will help -REDACTED-
as long as you get something to remember her lovers name. She will give you an ??? key. After that is over, you have control
again. Don't talk to her until you get what she needs. Go to the middle rooftop hallway I was talking about earlier.

<B><U>- THE MIDDLE ROOFTOP HALLWAY -</U></B>

Ok, just go into the room closest to you. The door to the right of the closest door will go to the same place.

<B><U>- THE RING AND LETTER (THE BUTLER'S LIBRARY) -</U></B>

Don't interact with the two bookcases in front of you, they don't have anything important. Go to the mini room
to the right. Interact with the bookcase to the left corner. You'll read a dairy and get a apology letter. But
this isn't enough to please Rosa. There is another item to get. Go to the paper between the two mini rooms.
It's give you a clue where to go next. "Look to where the right clock ticks. From there go 5 paces south. Then 
2 paces south east. From there go 1 pace east." Do exactly what it says and there will be a secret hole to enter from.
Once you find that hole (by interacting it), You'll be in a crawling space. Go all the way to the right and you'll
see a dead body. Interact with it and you'll get a ring. But once you leave the that crawling space, an action scene will
appear. After that is over, it'll make you leave the room automatically. Now go to Rosa. You got both of the items that will please her.

<B><U>- HERE YOU GO! (THE BUTLER'S ROOM) -</U></B>

Beware at this part. You'll have choices to what to do with Rosa. MAKE SURE YOU GIVE BOTH THE LETTER AND THE RING, ANYTHING OTHER THEN
THAT CHOICE WILL RESULT IN DEATH!

The correct choice:

1. Present item
2. Present something else
3. Present ring and letter

After you made those choices, a cutscene will appear; Rosa will thank you and give you -REDACTED- to use -REDACTED-. Now leave the
room.

<B><U>- YOU OKAY MARIO? (LEFT ROOFTOP HALLWAY) -</U></B>

Interact with Mario, you'll get a cutscene. After that cutscene is over, you'll be playing as Mario. Now to the rooftop, it is to the 
left of you.

<B><U>- MARIO! NO! (BOSS) -</B></U>

Once you get up here a cutscene will play. After it you'll battle -REDACTED-. The best way to defeat the boss is to stand still.
The boss will come to you, an action scene will appear. Complete it three times and you will beat the boss. Many, many cutscenes will play
and that is it...

game but now you can. Interact with it, a cutscene will play and you'll get the forest gate key. But now an action
scene will play. Once you sucessfully beat the action scene, Mario and Luigi will try to run but Mario slows down. He

it to open that pathway for you. Once you get it open. continue on your way down there. YOU MUST GO DOWN HERE FIRST!

&nbsp;It was a long way to get here but I finally made it. I get a eerie feeling though... What could it be?<br>
&nbsp;It's probably from the rain, it makes the place seem dark and gloomy.<br>
<br>
<B><U>2. Couple in the photo</B></U><br>
&nbsp;I found a photo of what seems to be from a wedding. For some reason the faces were blurred out. There<br>
&nbsp;was also some torn entries saying that she regrets doing horrible things to her family. I wonder what she did.<br>
<br>
<B><U>3. Someone wants me dead</B></U><br>
&nbsp;In the library there was a photo of me on a desk. Who took this photo? Where did they get it? Clearly I am<br>
&nbsp;not alone in this home. But who else would be in here? The only person who knows I am in the home is<br>
&nbsp;Princess Peach, and I doubt she would even pull a prank like this to me.<br>

<B><U>4. Girl with Scissors</B></U><br>
&nbsp;A girl with scissors in her hands almost attacked me! The door behind me closed so I had to force it open.<br>
&nbsp;Thankfully I made it out alive. Who was this child? It was like a ghost that had taken physical form.<br>
<br>
<B><U>5. An Investigation</B></U><br>
&nbsp;It seems that the home has already been investigated once, I might have to look around for any reports.<br>
&nbsp;Maybe there is a newpaper or some writing about the investigation here.<br>

&nbsp;What was that dream about? I wonder who was the child, I remember her from somewhere...<br>
&nbsp;Also who was that woman? She said something about the music box... I wonder if it's even<br>
&nbsp;safe anymore. Maybe my new friend Riba can help me get out of here.<br>
<br>
<B><U>10. Someone is dead?</B></U><br>
&nbsp;Someone apparently died in some accident... or atleast it's what some think. The person<br>
&nbsp;who wrote the note says it was murder. It is stated that the person died from falling<br>
&nbsp;off the garden cliff. I will probably have to check there some time to see if it was an<br>
&nbsp;accident.<br>
<br>
<B><U>11. Girl with the red hair</B></U><br>
&nbsp;I saw the child again, I wonder who she is and what is her involvement in the home.<br>
&nbsp;Is she trying to reach out to me, or does she also want to bring me to death?<br>
<br>
<B><U>12. A killer among the family</B></U><br>
&nbsp;The woman murdered one of the servants, I don't know if she was involved with Aria's<br>
&nbsp;death or anyone else that has died. I'm scared to know that this woman is using my body,<br> 
&nbsp;but why does she want my body? What is her purpose?<br>
<br>
<B><U>13. There's strange arrows on the wall</B></U><br>
&nbsp;Left, left, up, right, up, right, up.<br>
<br>
<B><U>14. Mercy</B></U><br>
&nbsp;I found an old news article about this woman. She seemed to have been related to Alice,<br>
&nbsp;the head of the home after the father mysteriously died. It looks like she became yet<br>
&nbsp;another malevolent spirit. I feel sorry for her, her kids were sacrified to some ritual.<br>
&nbsp;Mercy has no hope of resting, she's too far off gone.<br>
<br>
<B><U>15. Abuse to Anna</B></U><br>
&nbsp;The red haired girl(Anna) was adopted, shes seemed to have been adopted just a few months<br>
&nbsp;before Alice(her mother) gave birth. She seemed to have done something so bad that the<br>
&nbsp;mother constantly abused her. I wonder what she did.<br>
<br>
<B><U>16. A blonde haired girl</B></U><br>
&nbsp;She's most likely another victim of this 'ritual'. Like Aria, she had no memory of her<br>
&nbsp;death... poor girl. She doesn't seem to be older than 6 years old. I saw a vision of her<br>
&nbsp;sister brutally murdering her with a shovel and burying her alive. The motive seemed to<br>
&nbsp;be out of jealousy but it's too cruel... Another thing I noticed is that she also has<br>
&nbsp;those gray eyes... where have I seen them before?<br>
<br>
<B><U>17. Family photo</B></U><br>
&nbsp;I found a photo of the family in the home. There's a blurred out child, but something else<br>
&nbsp;caught my eye... Riba?! Why is he in this photo? Could he have been a spirit all along?<br>
<br>
<B><U>18. Truth</B></U><br>
&nbsp;Alice had hysteria due to her condition. This could explain the harsh behavior towards Anna<br>
&nbsp;and the sudden murders of her family members. Riba was the father of Serina, Alice was the<br>
&nbsp;mother, they gave birth to her to sacrifice her in some ritual that would make Alice an<br>
&nbsp;entity to live forever with Riba. Anna became an entity herself due to anger and regret,<br>
&nbsp;she did the best she could to stop her mother from escaping the home. Trapped her in the<br>
&nbsp;music box I currently possess... but what do I have to do to stop the curse? Do I have to<br>
&nbsp;seal Alice's soul in the music box once more? How will I get Alice's spirit to leave my<br>
&nbsp;body? There's so many questions but I have no answers. I have found out the truth, there's<br>
&nbsp;no need for us to be stuck in this nightmare any longer.<br>

I just wanted to say thanks for picking this guide out of all of the other ones. I made this guide for fun. I love
to make guides of the games I played. I really enjoyed playing this game. Great story, great character devolpement,
and the gameplay was intersting and at best fun. Wish this game wasn't based on RPG Maker but its not too bad. I made
acouple games myself on there, and it was just as fun playing them as of making them. Anyways, once again Jessica.
This game is absolutely beautiful, you couldn't even make it better. I thank you, the team, and the supporters of this
game. I hope ARC comes out as fast as possible. I would love to make a walkthrough for it.
